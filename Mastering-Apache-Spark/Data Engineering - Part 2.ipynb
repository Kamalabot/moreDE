There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.  My particular street is very much in transition definitely going through gentrification. My block has now three renovated buildings, including mine and I suspect in a few years, will be completely different.  My immediate neighborhood is a mix of people - a real reflection of NYC diversity - Asian, Latin, Jewish, Black, young professionals, hipsters, artists, etc. It's a cool mix.

If you expect perfection, it's best you book a hotel. :)</td><td>F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.

There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.  My particular street is very much in transition definitely going through gentrification. My block has now three renovated buildings, including mine and I suspect in a few years, will be completely different.  My immediate neighborhood is a mix of people - a real reflection of NYC diversity - Asian, Latin, Jewish, Black, young professionals, hipsters, artists, etc. It's a cool mix.

If you expect perfection, it's best you book a hotel. :)</td><td>F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.  The East Broadway stop is the last stop in Manhattan before it heads to Dumbo in Brooklyn The F train also goes up the center of Manhattan and can take you to the East Village, Soho, West Village, Chelsea, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the southern part of Central Park. It's the best train! :)</td><td>Guests have access to the whole apartment.</td><td>As we will be sharing the apartment, interaction is a given.

Lots of books and graphic novels.</td><td>I live across the hall, so I usually stick to myself except for check-in, though if I'm not too busy, I'm often up for a beer around the corner!</td><td>Lock ALL doors tightly behind you. Clean your dishes before you go to bed or go out. Any food trash goes in the small trash next to the sink, and recycling all goes in the big black can next to the fridge. No tobacco smoking inside. You can smoke out front or on the roof. In the extreme cold, the top of the stairs should be fine. If you go to the roof, prop the hallway and roof doors open. When you leave, shut them both.  The front roof door can be tricky.. Please put CDs and records back in their cases! Leave the keys inside the bedroom when you leave.

It still has a bit of graffiti and grit and is full of vibrant ethnic enclaves but is very safe and you simply won't find a younger, funner place in NYC. The apartment is steps to great restaurants (probably the best in the city), bars (definitely the best in the city), cafes, and anything else you could want.  Within a few minutes' walk you'll find: a huge arcade bar, a whiskey-slash-grilled-cheese bar, the most famous steakhouse in the country, dirt-cheap dives, incredible speakeasy cocktail bars, and the best pizza place in NYC.</td><td>Please have a great time! And even though the area is lively and a lot of fun, the apartment itself is VERY quiet, in case that's a concern. Oh, and it's a walk-up/no elevator. All guests must be able to climb stairs with their bags. Same day guests must message me before Instant Booking to confirm availability, and checkin may be later than the listed time if we can make it work. Beginning April 26, the L train (nearest subway) will be undergoing long-term maintenance, resulting in slightly longer waits late at night and on weekends. The trains will still be running (the \"L Train Shutdown\" you may have heard about was actually canceled), and should be operating normally on weekdays, making the impact minimal to non-existant. Still, guests should be aware of this!</td><td>The subway (L train) is literally around the corner (you don't even need to cross the street) and is quick and very safe—even late at night. You can get just about anywhere in the city in minutes. Union Square is about 10 minutes away, the East Village about 7 minutes. It really is about as convenient a location as you'll find for getting around.  We also have several CitiBike bike-share stations within steps of the building. For $10 a day (or a longer-term subscription), you get unlimited access to these bikes, parked throughout the entire city.  The neighborhood itself is also very walkable, with tons to do, eat, shop, and drink in the immediate vicinity. Be like the locals and walk!</td><td>Guests have access to an enormous and beautiful apartment in a great part of town, steps from the subway. Your private room has a private balcony, and is on a completely separate floor from where I sleep (meaning tons of privacy). You have your own bathroom, access to the kitchen, living room, and pretty much whatever else you like. You can come and go as you please, 24 hours a day, and you won't disturb me. I also offer free laundry with overnight drop-off service for guests staying at least six nights.</td><td>That's up to you! If you'd rather I didn't exist, I understand. If you want to grab a beer and talk about your trip and getting the most out of NYC, I'm happy to (assuming I'm not slammed with work)! There are also occasions when I have to travel at the last minute. So if I have to skip town for work, I apologize, and hope you enjoy the private apartment!</td><td>-All guests must read the full listing (particularly the sections labeled \"The Space\" and \"Other things to note\") BEFORE booking.

I dont have many rules. The two most important of these rules: You absolutely MUST keep the shared bathroom clean. This means cleaning out the drain trap after every shower whether you wash your hair or not. This means not leaving hair on the floor of the bathroom. And this means not leaving the bathroom mirror dirty after every use. The second important rule is following the recycling rules. I don't want to keep your deposit. This is not some way for me to make more money. I genuinely want you to feel relaxed and welcome in my home. Some rules are necessary for good co-habitation, even short term.

I provide excellent customer service, clean rooms in a great neighborhood, all in a beautiful apartment in the best city in the world, New York City!</td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>N/A</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/72062/profile_pic/1405562308/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/72062/profile_pic/1405562308/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Alphabet City</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews']</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>New York, NY, United States</td><td>East Village</td><td>East Village</td><td>Manhattan</td><td>New York</td><td>NY</td><td>10009</td><td>New York</td><td>New York, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.72555</td><td>-73.97965</td><td>t</td><td>Apartment</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>4</td><td>1.0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",\"Wheelchair accessible\",Kitchen,Doorman,Gym,Breakfast,Elevator,\"Free street parking\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"24-hour check-in\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Self check-in\",\"Building staff\",\"Children’s books and toys\",\"Pack ’n Play/travel crib\",\"Hot water\",\"Coffee maker\",Dishwasher,Oven,\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\"}</td><td>850</td><td>$225.00 </td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2</td><td>$30.00 </td><td>1</td><td>15</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>1.0</td><td>15.0</td><td>yesterday</td><td>t</td><td>5</td><td>35</td><td>65</td><td>340</td><td>12/5/2019</td><td>123</td><td>23</td><td>7/6/2010</td><td>11/24/2019</td><td>94</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1.07\r</td></tr><tr><td>27531</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/27531</td><td>2.01912E13</td><td>12/5/2019</td><td>Eveland Private Bed & Living Room w/ Own Entrance</td><td>Create a memorable vacation or business trip by staying at this clean, relaxing, comfortable private bedroom and living room in family-friendly Park Slope.

Less than 20 Minutes to Manhattan. You can see a map in my photos.</td><td>You have access to your bedroom, living room, all bathrooms, kitchen and the backyard.</td><td>I will be sharing the apartment with you and will be available to answer any questions.</td><td>My rules are simple: • Please note every human in your group must be included in the guest numbers so I don't exceed my maximum capacity of 4 people.  I do not have a 'children stay free' policy. Every person in your group must be included in the guest numbers regardless of age. My policy is that guests of any age are charged the same. Therefore Airbnb's system will not calculate the correct guest numbers and accommodation fee when they're under 2's included. To manually override this, enter children under 2 as though they were in the 2-12 category. This will make sure you know exactly what you'll be charged BEFORE you book. • No pets - sorry fido has to stay home • No parties, no outside visitors or overnight guests without previous approval from your host. • Do not engage in illegal activities anywhere on the property. • If you break or damage something, please let me know and arrange for its replacement or repair. • Do not leave any food out that will attract uninvited pests.

The \"C\" train (10 minutes to Lower Manhattan) is a 1/2  block from the building. The \"G\" train (for traveling between Brooklyn &  Queens) is 3 blocks away.

About another 5 minutes of walking to Prospect Park. About a 10 minute walk from Fort Greene Park. The same for restaurants, bars and shopping in the area.

He is a rescue I adopted after he was removed from his previous owner due to neglect.****</td><td>The \"C\" train is 1/2 block (about 150 meters) from the apartment and the \"G\" train is 2 1/2 blocks from the apartment. Easy to get in and out of Manhattan at any time of day.</td><td>Full access to the kitchen, living room and bathroom. Basically all areas of the apartment except my bedroom.</td><td>I like to interact with guests as much or as little as they want to interact with me. I work freelance and have odd hours at times, but when I can I am happy to chat, have drinks or even share a meal. I want my guests to feel less like guests and more like friends or family.</td><td>We would hope you come to NYC, enjoy your stay and tell your friends about the wonderful place you stayed at! While I consider the apartment suitable for children up to 12, please contact me before you book so I can talk to you about the room and potential sleeping arrangements.  Please remove shoes when inside the apartment. No pets. NO SMOKING. Other than that it's about common courtesy! If you use the kitchen clean up like it was your home, be quiet coming in late or leaving early.

I am a working mother and artist who lives in one of the best neighborhoods in New York City with my teenaged son, Idriys, and our adorable toy poodle, Chester.  We have been offering our properties since 2010 in NYC and since 2013 in Washington DC. I manage the property in DC for my big sister, Khadijah, who is an attorney and interior designer. She lives in the attached house there. While I will handle all of your arrangements beforehand, I am based in NYC. Upon arrival, Khadijah will be your host in Washington DC.\n\nIn NYC, you will meet me, Idriys, and Chester. I am an actor/writer/director who is now beginning to study music. My son, Idriys, is my favorite thing. He loves art, sports, literature and music and is extremely good with small children (and animals) if you ever need a babysitter. We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them. What a wonderful way to make a living by providing a peaceful environment, good energy, and a home away from home to people during their travels. We hope to do the same for you!</td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>N/A</td><td>t</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Clinton Hill</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>Brooklyn, NY, United States</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Clinton Hill</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>NY</td><td>11238</td><td>New York</td><td>Brooklyn, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.6863</td><td>-73.96765</td><td>t</td><td>Condominium</td><td>Private room</td><td>3</td><td>1.5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Pets allowed\",\"Pets live on this property\",\"Free street parking\",\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"Lock on bedroom door\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Private living room\",\"Children’s books and toys\",\"Pack ’n Play/travel crib\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",\"Extra pillows and blankets\",\"Coffee maker\",Refrigerator,\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\",Other}</td><td>550</td><td>$135.00 </td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>$250.00 </td><td>$90.00 </td><td>2</td><td>$40.00 </td><td>4</td><td>730</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>730</td><td>730</td><td>4.0</td><td>730.0</td><td>5 weeks ago</td><td>t</td><td>21</td><td>51</td><td>81</td><td>356</td><td>12/6/2019</td><td>90</td><td>13</td><td>8/7/2010</td><td>10/25/2019</td><td>97</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0.79\r</td></tr><tr><td>32100</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32100</td><td>2.01912E13</td><td>12/5/2019</td><td>Modern Greenpoint, Brooklyn Apt</td><td>Our spacious three-bedroom modern apartment in hip Greenpoint is just waiting for you!

Pleasure, business or both I'm happy to share my vast NYC knowledge with you.\r\n\r\nJune 1, 2010:  As a long time resident of NY, I've been living in NYC for the past 5 years, but grew up in the suburbs about 30 miles east on Long Island. Currently, I'm working as an Interior designer / General Contractor with an emphasis on performing the finish work myself and crew(s). \r\n\r\nAfter traveling all around the U.S.A. for a Sales job for a few years after  graduating college, I've learned a ton about the hospitality business, traveling in general and have how to treat people by doing my very best to surpass expectations. I provide excellent customer service, clean rooms in a great neighborhood, all in a beautiful apartment in the best city in the world, New York City!</td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>N/A</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/72062/profile_pic/1405562308/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/72062/profile_pic/1405562308/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Alphabet City</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews']</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>New York, NY, United States</td><td>East Village</td><td>East Village</td><td>Manhattan</td><td>New York</td><td>NY</td><td>10009</td><td>New York</td><td>New York, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.72518</td><td>-73.98034</td><td>t</td><td>Apartment</td><td>Private room</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",\"Wheelchair accessible\",\"Smoking allowed\",Doorman,Gym,Breakfast,Elevator,Heating,Washer,Dryer,Essentials,\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\",Microwave,\"Coffee maker\",Refrigerator,\"Dishes and silverware\"}</td><td>null</td><td>$125.00 </td><td>$750.00 </td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>2</td><td>$0.00 </td><td>1</td><td>730</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>730</td><td>730</td><td>1.3</td><td>730.0</td><td>3 days ago</td><td>t</td><td>13</td><td>41</td><td>71</td><td>346</td><td>12/6/2019</td><td>94</td><td>21</td><td>8/17/2010</td><td>10/25/2019</td><td>95</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0.83\r</td></tr><tr><td>44229</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/44229</td><td>2.01912E13</td><td>12/6/2019</td><td>BROOKLYN VICTORIAN STYLE SUITE.....</td><td>Very Large room with King size Bed and your very own bathroom, very own wifi .</td><td>Welcome to Brooklyn Victorian Style Suite ...This a room of all rooms fitted with a KING SIZE BED  and a beautiful  private bathroom .....

Yes, I needed to join, but specificity was always a mantra of my youthful experience. Because of my rural  \"beyond the grid\" upbringing, I learnt early, sitting by the wood fires, contemplating my future, that while others wonder if the glass is half full or empty, I, having seen where water came from, was more aware of whether the well was half full or three quarters empty. So early on my broader awareness would allow me to give in a different way to the world while I became who I must be. So the wide data pipes of my first company, were a mirror of the flow of infinite resources parsed out to the people who thirsted for it. So I always remain true to the saying of Lao Tsu Tzank as transmitted to me by an Amero- Indian medicine man channel, LargeThinking Bear; \"For you have little to make into a lot, and use it wisely for the self benefit of others as you enrich the cosmos.\" I repeat that to myself every night. It is my silent toast of single malt smokey scotch, my song deep in my romantic core as I execute business deals at 40,000 feet.

Some hotel lobbyist have managed to pass a bill alongside NYC's mayor that makes Airbnb somewhat illegal in some cases.

It also serves as a place to host my extensive family when they come to the city for visits.  Recently I got married and as my wife has a 14 year old. So that John could have his own room, we had to move to a two bedroom apartment nearby, right on 18th street and First Ave., very close-by so if you need anything, be sure to let me know and I will do my best to accommodate any request.

In 1980 he joined the Escola de Música de Brasília (EMB), where he was selected to participate in the children's choir that performed on the first Opera seasons of Brasília. At 14 years of age, after a pause from his studies at the EMB, Leonardo started playing electric-bass, having performed with various rock bands of his home town. In 1987, he returned to the EMB where, for the first time, he was exposed to an acoustic-bass. In 1989, during an exchange program to Canada, Leonardo participated in a jazz festival and won a scholarship to study at Berklee College of Music.

Its basically at the border of Gramercy and Flatiron. In nice weather you can walk anywhere - ten minutes to Chelsea, East Village, etc. The nearby architecture is lovely, the streets are clean and sidewalks not too crowded.  Curry Hill is a block to the east, with great Indian food and groceries... Eataly is a block to the west, a must-visit Italian market with fresh fish/meat/produce and a bunch of mini-restaurants. Tons of great restaurants nearby. And if avant-garde fashion is your thing, Dover Street NY is very cool and very close.</td><td>null</td><td>The 6 train and the N/R are 1 blk away, so you have the rare treat of being east but able to get to the west side pretty easily. Express buses run up and down Park and Madison Avenues, great for museum trips. There's a Citibike dock right across the street.</td><td>Guests have full and exclusive access to the apartment, which comes stocked with pantry basics, coffee and tea, paper products, a hair dryer, designated closet space, umbrellas.</td><td>Guests enjoy total privacy - it's their apartment - although I am just a text or email away should they need anything. Note that I do live in this apartment - it's not a \"vacation property.\"</td><td>The main rule is the Golden Rule - please treat the apartment and building with respect. In addition, no parties and no overnight guests that haven't been previously approved by me. A book in the apartment provides check-out procedures, wireless access codes, appliance instructions, arrival/departure instructions etc. Also there are takeout menus, my own neighborhood guide and several other city/neighborhood guides.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/178504b9-9177-43dc-812e-25b775a9d91a.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>null</td><td>275578</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/275578</td><td>R</td><td>10/31/2010</td><td>New

We were able to easily access nearby restaurants and cafes and enjoyed walking everywhere during our free time. Great weather afforded us the opportunity to have breakfast on the deck which boasts amazing morning sun. Lila provided a really helpful ‘welcome’ book for our stay (which we referenced multiple times!) and there were clear labels on all lights and appliances for ease of use. While our schedules prevented us from saying “Hello!” in person, Lila was only a message away if we needed anything which made us feel even more at ease. The apartment was clean, quiet, and a perfect fit for our weekend away from home. We would definitely stay again!

By day 2 I had to force myself to take a walk because I realized I didn't have to go beyond a 3 block radius to have everything I need. The apartment itself is well laid out with calm and yet homey design. The light it receives is beautiful all day long. Plus the neighborhood is awesome. Pratt and Fort Greene are all an easy walk away and you have all the restaurants and cafes you need right out the door. I also really enjoyed my class at Dou Yoga around the corner. I would highly recommend this place for a single person or a couple. If you will be arriving to New York via Penn Station: It is such an easy commute and Lila was very flexible with my moving arrival time. I can't wait to make a return trip myself.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>56178132</td><td>12/10/2015</td><td>8258300</td><td>Brigitte</td><td>Vielen Dank Lila für die wunderschöne Zeit in Ihrem Apartment.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>56291530</td><td>12/11/2015</td><td>3454244</td><td>Andrew</td><td>What an amazing apartment in such an incredible location.

Downside which I knew about from reading other reviews but didn't think through enough, was that there is no kitchen sink and so we had to use the one in the shower room.

Lila was the perfect host by greeting us, explaining the most important things about our stay, and then we never saw her again. She has a friendly air about her for sure and we look forward to renting her peaceful parlor apartment again one day! Oh and I forgot to mention that there is a private deck on the outside of the back of apartment that must be so fun to use in the summertime.

We walked to the High Line on the first day, across Brooklyn Bridge - a long walk but very memorable and absolutely wonderful. The flat was stylish, clean, wholesome and characterful and we loved the fact that it was so easy to walk to the subway and to some great restaurants (especially Aita and Emily's). The street was typically Brooklyn, lined with brownstone properties and with lots of trees. Having the terrace to sit out on was lovely although not so useful in November.

Clinton Hill is a fab spot in Brooklyn... a gorgeous, leafy, peaceful residential area with great restaurants and bars [and great coffee!] right on your doorstep. Our favourite was Locanda Vini & Olii which is right on the corner of the street - amazing food & wine and brilliant staff. Beautiful parks and gardens are close by too - just a short stroll away. Everything you could ask for! The apartment itself far exceeded our expectations... it is even more beautiful in reality than it looks online [which is saying something]. Lila has incredible taste and truly you couldn't want for anything more in terms of comfort. Brilliant bed and linen and stylish furnishings. And, if the season is on your side, the outdoor deck is a bonus too! The subway is close by and an easy ride into Manhattan. We even walked from the apartment into town, quite a few times, over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. Lila herself was a great host and very responsive with any communication. Honestly, unless you are hell-bent on staying in the thick of it, which we were not, you won't do better than this apartment. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks again Lila for a wonderful stay.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>153227857</td><td>5/20/2017</td><td>22520672</td><td>Carmen</td><td>We enjoyed our short stay in that amazing place very much! Lila was very easy to communicate with and very helpful. Lila's place is exactly as described on Airbnb. Very spacious and clean, located in a quiet neighbourhood in central Brooklyn. Kitchen is basic but still enough equipped for cooking a pasta dish or soup - but regarding all the nice restaurants so close by you wouldn't want to stay inside for cooking ;-) Overall our stay (with two little kids under age 3) was a very nice experience and we definitely can recommend Lila's place!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>154822635</td><td>5/26/2017</td><td>35227676</td><td>Olivia</td><td>Very spacious and beautifull apartment in a quiet road in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. Everything as pictured, large living room, nice kitchen area and beautifull porch (which we unfortunately couldn't use due to the weather). Lila left coffe and some oatmeal and cereal bars for breakfast (which were delightfull, we just went and bought some packages) and you can easily buy any additionals in the many grocery stores on Fulton Road and store them in the fridge. Great area with easy access to Manhattan by C Train. Lovely restaurants just a couple of meters away (Locanda Vini and The Finch)!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>157726028</td><td>6/4/2017</td><td>751474</td><td>Amy</td><td>Wonderful stay in this Brooklyn brownstone!

Es una persona amable y dispuesta. El apartamento es cómodo y no se oyen ruidos. La zona es segura y pintoresca. El subte está a unas pocas cuadras y se tarda entre 20 y 30 minutos en cruzar a Manhattan. La cocina es cómoda. El baño es reducido pero los espacios han sido bien aprovechados. El sofá cama es muy práctico, si viajan con niños es una buena opción. Nuestra experiencia fue muy buena y la recomendaríamos.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>167680799</td><td>7/7/2017</td><td>132061184</td><td>Jerry</td><td>Wonderful Stay.

We enjoyed 'living' in a characteristic Brooklyn neighbourhood and with the close proximity to two subway lines and the fabulous neighbourhood cafes and restaurants that were so close, the apartment was the perfect place for us to relax and enjoy the peacefulness.  Lila was extremely quick to respond to my questions and was very accommodating with suggestions of activities etc.  The Welcome Book was full of information and ideas as well as the excellent Brooklyn guide that was also provided and helped with our planning of what to see and do.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>174282324</td><td>7/25/2017</td><td>1134109</td><td>Veerle</td><td>We enjoyed our stay at Lila's place.

The apartment is a large partitioned section of the parlor floor with high ceilings and great mid-century furnishings. The toilet and shower areas are very small and the only sink is in the shower room so dishes are a bit of a challenge but otherwise, the place is spacious. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>181381409</td><td>8/12/2017</td><td>122158560</td><td>Takashi</td><td>We had a wonderful day. A comfortable bed. Kitchen necessary for cooking. Quiet environment. Balcony where sunrise and squirrel will come. A little inconvenience in living is certainly a thing in life. However, more pleasure is felt during stay. Rather, it was a room that made me feel like coming home to be relieved for the active day.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>184410372</td><td>8/19/2017</td><td>20035231</td><td>Vanessa</td><td>Location, cleanliness, convenience, amenities, Lila's place is the perfect Brooklyn home away from home. The neighborhood was incredible, so many fantastic restaurants, local watering holes, and shops. We really enjoyed Clinton Hill and our friends who live in Jersey/Queens who came to visit us fell in love with the neighborhood also, now they all want to move Clinton Hill! ;) There is no bedroom, it's like a studio setup which is fine and very NYC, however just good to know ahead of time. Also the bathroom is separated into a toilet behind 1 door and separate area for shower/sink behind another door. Both were tiny but for NYC standards we totally get it and it was not an issue at all. The back patio really adds to the element of the space, it was so peaceful and truly helped us appreciate all Brooklyn and borough life has to offer! We will be back :)</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>187237563</td><td>8/26/2017</td><td>20001944</td><td>Dominic</td><td>Lila's place is an oasis of calm in the city.

Some days I wished I didn't have to go in to Manhattan so I could explore further. Lila's recommendations for local places to eat were spot on and  she was incredibly responsive and helpful. I'll be back - to coin a phrase... Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>188512962</td><td>8/29/2017</td><td>14521911</td><td>Philippe</td><td>Spacious, well lit, and beautifully furnished space, located super close to trains into Manhattan and in a great walkable neighborhood.

The neighborhood has nearly anything you could want within a 15 minute walk in one direction or another. Very safe. My favorite feature of this rental was the bedding. High quality materials and thoughtful placement. I slept really well.

Reasonable size fridge and kitchenette with small table make self catering of basic meals convenient.  Difficult to do full meal cooking due to  shared bathroom and kitchen basin and lack of oven.  Lila's place is located short walk to C line station to Manhattan and in a leafy, quiet street.  We would not hesitate to recommend Lila's place to other guests.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>198182911</td><td>9/28/2017</td><td>11478231</td><td>Rémi</td><td>Hi Lila,\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>199965428</td><td>10/3/2017</td><td>3953</td><td>Lynn</td><td>We had a great time staying at Lylus place. It is a wonderful location and just steps away from great bars, cafés and hip restaurants with great food. It’s a beautiful tree-lined Brown Stone Street in Clinton Hill with easy access to the subway. The house was extremely clean with a great deck off of the kitchen. We slept very well in a comfortable bed and enjoyed preparing food in the morning before we went out and enjoyed the neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>200509853</td><td>10/5/2017</td><td>28592262</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Lila's place was as advertised and utterly charming.

The high ceilings makes the flat feel so much bigger than it really is, and Lila and Paul have done a stellar job at creating a comfortable and attractive environment. There was excellent communication with the hosts and speaking as a personal lover of label makers, I was very pleased to find that all the switches were clearly identified. Some might be surprised to find the only sink in the bathroom, but it was such a small detail I wouldn't really call it an inconvenience. The neighborhood is great and close to transportation. All in all, you won't be disappointed with your stay.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>211822567</td><td>11/14/2017</td><td>64035156</td><td>Jamie</td><td>We had a great stay at Lila & Paul’s place.  We come to Brooklyn often and will definitely stay here again. Like other guests have said, this is not a one bedroom but more like a studio with a separate kitchen.  However the main room is so large that we were able to put both of our small children to bed and stay up (quietly) without disturbing them.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>213525174</td><td>11/21/2017</td><td>86058420</td><td>Dave</td><td>Great flat in a excellent location.

The location was perfect for us -   quiet street, quiet unit, close to our daughter's apartment, close to the Claussen subway stop, close to good restaurants, small Bodegas, and an easy walk to our favorite coffee shop 'Choice'. The photos on the Airbnb site were very accurate.  As other reviewers have noted, and as can be seen on the photos, there is not a sink in the kitchen, only a small sink in the bathroom connected to the kitchen. Takes some getting used to, but not a problem at all. We definitely look forward to staying there again.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>244377474</td><td>3/18/2018</td><td>101885780</td><td>Lily</td><td>My parents stayed here for the weekend.

Het huis ligt in een rustig deel van Brooklyn waar het veilig en vriendelijk voelde met om de hoek de nodige voorzieningen zoals een goede supermarkt, een drankwinkel met lekkere wijnen (Leon & Sol) en een heel goede broodjes zaak (Gordon Savory). Er is een metro om de hoek die je zo naar Manhattan brengt. Onze ervaring was dat de reis meestal zo’n 45 minuten duurde van deur naar deur naar een plek in Manhattan of van Manhattan terug naar het huis. Het was prettig om na de drukte van het centrum in het idyllische en rustige wijkje terug te komen. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>268974542</td><td>5/26/2018</td><td>121415170</td><td>Robin</td><td>This is a WOW!

As an added bonus for us there were quite a few vegan food places nearby, including a really sweet bar at the end of the street.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>563684019</td><td>11/13/2019</td><td>121415170</td><td>Robin</td><td>Again, a lovely stay in this charming and spacious brownstone in a great neighborhood within walking distance of the important things, yummy food and subways!  :)\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>564735608</td><td>11/16/2019</td><td>39809194</td><td>Ariane</td><td>Amazing!</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>10925087</td><td>3/13/2014</td><td>11835757</td><td>Andrea & Ruddy</td><td>Alors par où commencer... \n</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>11017054</td><td>3/17/2014</td><td>12426431</td><td>Vicky</td><td>Shalyn and Chris were great hosts!

Their dog Zuzu is adorable, and the quietest dog I have ever seen. The neighborhood is a bit shabby, but Bushwick is supposed to be the next trendy area in Brooklyn, so it can only get better. It felt very safe too. The subway is only 5 minutes away, and the trains take you to Time Square in less than 20mn. The place is very cute and clean, but I do not recommend it to people with bad knees since the ladder that leads to the bed is very steep and the steps are far apart. Also the sleeping space is a bit cramped, so if you are the kind of person who likes spreading their things, you will not feel comfortable. Other than that, if you are young and traveling light, I totally recommend Shalyn and Christopher's place!</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>18791663</td><td>9/1/2014</td><td>7028093</td><td>Michelle</td><td>Shalyn and Christopher were very accommodating and welcoming hosts. Their space was clean, and while the climb to the top of the loft space was a little scary the first night, we were pros at climbing up and down by our last day. The neighbourhood itself is a little sketchy, but we never felt unsafe walking to and from the subway station (which was a super close 5 min walk away!). For anyone concerned about their dog Zuzu, she is very quiet and sweet. Overall I would definitely recommend staying at Shalyn and Christopher's place. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>20196848</td><td>9/25/2014</td><td>20443521</td><td>Petra</td><td>I think I could describe this in one sentence: Wonderful first experience.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>21129603</td><td>10/12/2014</td><td>13498770</td><td>Margarethe</td><td>Amazing place to stay!

All good things in once. Both the apartment and the host are very warm and very welcoming. The neighborhood is quiet. We felt always safe even when we got back late in the night. Just 5 min to the subway and 15 min to Manhatten. We can't say enough good about our stay!!! We think best feedback is always: See you next year! </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>21676028</td><td>10/21/2014</td><td>4945497</td><td>Klaus Elmer</td><td>Landing after 12 hours of travel and being offered fresh coffee says it all.

The space was tidy and roomy, with a comfortable loft space, plenty of work space, and extra towels and blankets galore. And there was always a pot of coffee brewing in the morning, a godsend for a caffeine addict like myself. Being a few block walk away from the JMZ train stop was so convenient since I was bustling back and forth between Manhattan and Brooklyn during my trip.

Christopher gave great recommendations on local restaurants and cafes. Zuzu is the most adorable dog and is no trouble at all. The stairs are a little creaky up to the nook and the mattress isn't the most comfortable. Christopher wasn't there for much of our stay but his friend Putnam came bye to check we were okay and to walk Zuzu. Communication was great and I can definitely recommend  the flat. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>36956569</td><td>7/3/2015</td><td>32523499</td><td>Agathe</td><td>C'était la première fois que nous allions aux USA et notre séjour chez Christopher s'est très bien passé.

Christopher was kind enough to offer conversation, tea, and snacks to share .On top of that, Zsu Zsu is the sweetest & quietest pup ever.

He gave us space to do our own thing but also spent time with us and gave us loads of advice about the area and what we should do while we were in New York. The description of his apartment was completely accurate, it was so cosy and unique. And Zuzu is the best dog/co-host we have ever met. There`s two subway stations really close to Christopher's apartment which makes it easy to get from Brooklyn to Manhattan and there's plenty of places to eat and drink in the area. We really enjoyed spending time with Christopher, he made us laugh and made us breakfast, we'd definitely recommend staying with him. God bless the chickpea. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>40089622</td><td>7/28/2015</td><td>19799609</td><td>John</td><td>Christopher was a true gentleman and a great host to have for me and my girlfriend's stay in Brooklyn New York. He made us feel very welcome from the get go, giving us perfect directions from JFK airport to his place, and met us at his place at the exact planned time to let us in and give us keys. Throughout the trip he gave us privacy and tended to his own business which was nice. Me and my girlfriend did get a chance to get to know him a bit over breakfast's he made us, he even took us out for coffee at Lil Skip's on our last day for a  classic Brooklyn coffee experience! He's an interesting guy and a fellow artist like my girlfriend and I so we clicked well. His place is as advertised and it was really cozy and well kept. How often do you get to sleep on a handmade treehouse-like bed in a Brooklyn apartment? He had great recommendations for food and drink places, especially Mr Kiwi's which is a grocery store two minutes away, which saved us a lot of money over the trip. We were allowed to use his kitchen freely and enjoyed homemade breakfasts every morning with coffee in mason jars that he provided. His dog Zuzu was very adorable and friendly and made our trip even more pleasant. Chris's apartment is less than 5 minutes to the JMZ train which made all of New York accessible. The ride into manhattan was only 15 minutes. Bushwick felt very safe and we never had issues during our stay, even when we were out until 2 in the morning one night. We would happily stay at Chris's again and we are never staying in a hotel again. Airbnb is the way to go! I encourage you to book with Chris if you plan to travel to Brooklyn, he won't disappoint.</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>43510396</td><td>8/20/2015</td><td>13338299</td><td>Annette</td><td>Christopher is such a great guy! He really made my boyfriend and I feel welcome in his home. He is very easy-going and friendly, and he has a very cute and lovely dog which we came to be very good friends with. He was busy with work but still he found time to hang with us and cook breakfast for us. His home is just as it is shown on the pictures - cozy, clean and warm. It is very easy to go from his apartment to Manhattan, and we especially liked spending time in Williamsburg which his home is very close to. We can absolutely recommend other to live at Christopher's! </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>45399820</td><td>9/2/2015</td><td>5895308</td><td>Hänski</td><td>Christopher, Zuzu and his beautiful little cozy place in Brooklyn made our first time in New York an awesome experience !! The place looks exactly like in the pictures and we really liked hanging out there. The area is really vibrant since bushwick is an upcoming neighborhood with a cool flair to it. Cool Bars, awesome restaurants and cute little cafes are all in walking distance and make you totally forget about manhattan. Getting to manhattan is really easy though since there a two jmz train stations around the corner. So you can get there basically any day- or nighttime ! Williamsburg with its endless opportunities to hang out, shop or drink is also right around the corner. Christopher as a host was just the best. He totally made us feel welcome at his place !! communication beforehand was also really good and easy as well. He sometimes even made breakfast for us in the morning. When we came home after a long trip of sightseeing in manhattan we sometimes just hung out together with a couple of beers, talking about basically everything. It felt more like friends visiting a friend. I can totally recommend this place on every level. So thank you again Christopher for this great experience ! Oh yeah and Zuzu is really just the best =) </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>46426047</td><td>9/10/2015</td><td>42777496</td><td>Elia</td><td>As first experience with airbnb it was amazing!

It's only a 4mins walk to the L train - less than 20mins ride to Union Square. Definitely recommend the place even if you want to tour Manhattan! But the neighborhood is something I wanted to explore - close to Bushwick and Williamsburg and full of arts, laid-back Brooklyn feel. It can get quiet during night time but I felt safe the whole time. Barbara is very easy to communicate with. She keeps the place tidy and is very considerate. She recommended places in the neighborhood to explore - Roberta's is a must-try! Best pizza in NYC! Also I fell in love the City of Saints Coffee Roasters which was 2 blocks away. Their pour-over is to die for. </td></tr><tr><td>2331154</td><td>436584192</td><td>4/13/2019</td><td>5384270</td><td>Verena</td><td>The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival.

I visited during the holiday season so it was incredibly busy but Fany was kind enough to offer help at all times. The room is exactly as shown in the pictures. However, you can’t lock the room from inside(though that didn’t bother me because the place itself is super safe and the entire family is very respectful of your privacy).

Infine, il grado di pulizia generale dell'appartamento lascia piuttosto a desiderare.

The place was perfect for our needs, close to the Subway station, excellent food at Sylvia's a short walk away and despite the odd hours we were keeping, getting up at 4am or coming back at 6am our host was very understanding. The street itself was beautiful and tree lined and we did enjoy having access to the back garden area even though our schedule gave us very little time to enjoy it. Brenda and her daughter were the perfect hosts, checking in from time to time, providing bottled water, which we were very grateful for as it was so hot the week we were there. The air conditioning units helped to keep out oasis cool and comfortable. They also respected our privacy and made sure to text or ring the doorbell before entering. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here if you are planning an extended stay and I do hope to be able to visit and stay again in the future.

Even if Véronique is very inclusive she also respects your private life. The room I rented had everything I needed, a comfortable bed, a hanger and a drawer for my clothes, and a desk where I could study. My stay at Véronique's certainly raised my New York experience to another level beyond Times Square and tourist traps.

About the host: Veronique is a very nice host, she gave me lots of useful advice for visiting NYC, and she also lends you lots of maps and other useful things. I had a great time in NYC, I was very busy so we did not meet many times, but I would recommend staying at her place. The good-sized private room has everything you need: a comfortable bed, a desk, mirror etc. You probably might need to be comfortable with cats as her nice black cat comes around sometimes and wants to play, but for me this was nice and not a problem.

The apartment is small, but very cozy, clean and well equipped. I had my own room with a bunk bed and table. Location is great; the apartment is a couple blocks from the subway, and is located in East Village (great for people who enjoy bars). Keep in mind, the apartment is on the 5th floor and there are no elevators. It wasn't an issue for me. As other reviewers have stated, there is a very friendly and affectionate cat in the apartment. Great value for the price, much better than staying at a hostel or cheap hotel. I would stay here again if I needed a place in NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>23902224</td><td>12/14/2014</td><td>23240178</td><td>Lionel</td><td>Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans le quartier de Véronique qui nous a été de bon conseil pour découvrir la ville.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>24023149</td><td>12/17/2014</td><td>22351908</td><td>Katie</td><td>Veronique was wonderful!

Also loved the Lower East Side with cool places to have a meal or drinks. The apartment is not big, but it has everything you need for a solo stay. Also, Veronique went out of her way to make sure I had a great time, from giving me advice to actually showing me around town. Since the heating can't be turned off untill May 15th, it was pretty hot but the fans that were everywhere made it a comfortable stay anyway. Would definitely recommend staying here!  </td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>28566216</td><td>3/26/2015</td><td>11498390</td><td>Roland</td><td>Zunächst einmal war die Kommunkation vor der Anreise mit Veronique sehr verlässlich und informativ.

You don't have a view form the room window but anyway, who needs it when NYC is so close, waiting for exploration? In the nearest neighborhood you will find a lot of small cute restaurants - pizza, Indian, cafes and many more, as well as shops and subway which is 3 blocks away.

Getting up to the 5th floor was a workout but getting to my cozy quiet room made it worth it. I must say, the bathroom is very small; it reminded me of an airplane restroom. I only saw Véronique the day I checked in and she is lovely. We were both a bit frazzled as it was the day after the 2016 Election. I felt welcomed and understood. I am not a fan of cats (at all) but I loved Véronique's cat; she's very sweet.

If you want somewhere spacious, modern and hotel-like, then this is not for you; but Veronique makes this clear from the listing and the message I received before booking. This place really has character; I felt like I was staying with a friend, living in a really cool little corner of New York which is full of history. Veronique was friendly and had good recommendations for what to do in the local area, and it was lovely to have a little chat with her at the end of a long day exploring.

The place is really close to a metro station that took us to most of the touristic places of the city without changing the line; F or J lines took us to both Uptown and Downtown very fast, Little Italy and Chinatown are walking-distance and the Williamsburg Bridge is just a couple blocks away, so you can walk directly to Brooklyn's heart.  There are A LOT of great places to eat (Kat's Deli is just about few blocks away from the apartment!!) and for coffee lovers, there's a Blue Bottle Coffee shop right next to the building entrance.  My girlfriend and I agree that this is a good if you are just looking for a place to crush.</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>166483975</td><td>7/3/2017</td><td>121426393</td><td>Will</td><td>\"The location is perfect.

There is a loft bed, a small but functional bathroom, and a walk through kitchen. Perhaps if there was more than just myself it would have felt cramped, but I just felt cozy. The stairs up to the apartment itself are tough with heavy luggage, and I would recommend to travel lightly here. The location was phenomenal! There were many great restaurants within walking distance, and I was able to walk to central park over the course of a long morning, and was able to get to jfk on the subway /train when I left.</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>217101216</td><td>12/7/2017</td><td>1591855</td><td>David & Shelley</td><td>Great place in the lower east side!</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>218255682</td><td>12/11/2017</td><td>30326686</td><td>Eurydice Et Arthur</td><td>The flat was not clean, dirty dishes and insects in the sink ....but great localization.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>218568689</td><td>12/13/2017</td><td>28816095</td><td>Linwei</td><td>Veronique is very nice and thoughtful.

The only downside to the apartment is that the walls are remarkably thin so I could pretty much hear everything his roommate was doing and I felt bad waking up in the morning if he was still sleeping or coming back after a night out. Otherwise, it was a great space and a fun neighborhood to spend a couple weeks. </td></tr><tr><td>2346106</td><td>10799158</td><td>3/8/2014</td><td>10183472</td><td>Marion</td><td>We didn't get to meet will, but he has been really helpful and great!

Will is a very easy and communicative host, and though I didn't get to meet him he was always quick to respond to any messages on Airbnb, text or email. The neighborhood of the apartment is fantastic. There is everything you could possibly need in a three block radius (like you would expect most places in NYC) but it's also chilled out and neighborly. You can take the G train--though only convenient on the weekdays, or the ferry--which is a beautiful ride and pretty quick! The loft itself is very spacious, probably with most everything you would need to cook (though I didn't); there is also a pool table to use. Will and Rick, Will's roommate, keep everything very clean and tidy. The room is very large, especially by NYC standards, has comfy bed, desk, and lounging area. The only drawback was that the walls are really paper thin -- though to be honest since Rick works nights and I left early in the AM most days, it didn't bother me. Both Rick and Will were really nice and accommodating to everything I needed, I would definitely stay here again if I ever fine myself on a solo trip to NYC. Thanks Will!</td></tr><tr><td>2346106</td><td>13968062</td><td>6/9/2014</td><td>6521193</td><td>Terry And Piper</td><td>Will was very fast to communicate.

We did find a remote for a small air unit that hangs from the ceiling but it took several hours for the temp to get to a comfortable level. The bed was comfy and clean, The shared bathroom was clean but cluttered.. The loft was very noisy the night we stayed. There's a door that seems like it's right on the other side of the wall where the bed is located. It slammed shut five or six times during the night. Last but not least, it was a rainy night and there were at least two leaks in the ceiling that I could hear.

The bedroom is bigger than the impression you get from the picture and the bed is really comfy. The flat is the optimal starting point to explore Williamsburg, and very in tone with the image of the place, and also gives easy access to Manhattan by the L or J train, depending on where you're going. We were in New York for a week and stayed at Nora's place for the last few days. It felt great to be a place where we could cook our dinner and have breakfast, as New York is quite expensive. However, there's great eating places in the area, even for a gluten allergic vegetarian as myself.

For anyone with small kids, this was especially convenient.  At night, the neighborhood was quiet and close to the subway.  We had a blast!  On the way home, the kids not only chattered about our overnight stay, but spoke about our new friend, Ruby.

During our stay, we were not allowed to access to the wash room but Ruby took our clothes to wash and dry for us. The place is in the middle of 2 subway stations (3 lines). Walking 0.6 miles to the subway is not a big deal for us because we like to walk. Overall, we like her place.

One night it took 40 minutes to find a parking spot. I suggest not moving your car once you get there if possible and just walking/using public transportation. That was no reflection on the place or host but I'm assuming just part of being in such a huge city. Ruby was fabulous.

We were provided with a parking space in an enclosed garage which was very convenient. Faruk and Karen were extremely easy to communicate with and always willing to help when we needed anything. The price seemed a little high for the area, however, it was cheaper than getting three hotel rooms for our family.

I can't comment on the amenities nearby as we didn't have time to experience them, but the availability of a parking spot was very helpful for us, and we found it so easy to get to Manhattan from there.   Feeling safe is paramount to anyone's stay, and although the area appeared to have a few rough edges, we slept at ease knowing there was a 24 hr doorman guarding the building.</td></tr><tr><td>2349737</td><td>21795629</td><td>10/24/2014</td><td>22027333</td><td>Suelly</td><td>My mom and her sisters had an amazing experience.

We did find a very clean and tidy apartment, equipped with every comfort and very well decorated. The house is also very delicious and extremely quiet, even though close to a fairly busy street. And the terrace on the back is great for dinner in the evening. And also it’s in a strategic position: almost two blocks from Times Square and a few meters from restaurants, metro, laundries, musicals and shops. You will have no problem to move, eat, go shopping... and especially it’s positioned in a safe and lit street at night (there’s a lot of security around there). It’s worth all the money you pay!

It REALLY needs a professional cleaning top to bottom, side to side.  If this had been my first Airbnb rental, I would never rent through Airbnb again.  With just a thorough cleaning and a few inexpensive upgrades, this apartment would be fabulous.  The size is perfect for two or three people.  The air conditioners worked flawlessly.  Most of the necessities were provided with a fair amount of storage space and a large closet for clothing.  The location was the best, in a quiet neighborhood, quiet building, with the small porch off the back door, also quiet.  The wi-fi worked very well.  It’s just a short walk to subway, bus lines, and hundreds of restaurants.  A grocery store is a block away.  Also, there is a nice little park just across the street.  The check-in procedure is a little quirky but understandable.</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>35461571</td><td>6/19/2015</td><td>2062565</td><td>Kristy</td><td>Location Location location! for a short trip to NYC - this flat was incredible!

It's in a neighborhood with a lot of great restaurants and amazing bars all within walking distance. Times Square is a few short blocks away as is Broadway, Rockefeller Center, The Empire State building, shopping on 5th ave, Central Park, Bryant park and sooooo many other attractions. The subway is half a block away. The apartment looks just like the pictures shown. Clean and comfortable. The patio is very nice to have! It was a great place to sit outside, have coffee, and enjoy the quiet before rushing off into the noisy city streets. We met Andres and he showed us to the apt as soon as we got into the city. He even recommended some Broadway shows and restaurants to go to, which we did and all were amazing recommendations. All in all we would definitely stay here again.

Más allá de la ubicación, los detalles y el estado del departamento son tal cual lo que se ve en las fotos publicadas en AirBnb. Andrés es un gran anfitrión y nos trató de maravillas, solucionándonos, incluso, nuestra vuelta al aeropuerto JFK. Hay un único detalle que, en principio, complica el uso del departamento, se trata de que pocos días antes de irnos a NY nos enteramos que para ingresar de día debíamos dejar nuestras valijas en un depósito y que posteriormente Andrés se encargaría de llevarlas; a decir verdad, cumplió perfectamente con su compromiso, pero si se tiene en cuenta que llegar a NY nos llevó casi 24 horas de viaje (Buenos Aires - Santiago - Santiago - NY), el hecho de no contar con nuestras valijas y cosas inmediatamente al llegar fue una carga. Más allá de eso, es entendible la necesidad de manejarse con cautela al entrar y salir teniendo en cuenta las fuertes multas de las que pueden ser pasibles los dueños de departamentos ofrecidos en alquiler temporario en la ciudad de NY. En resumen, salvo por el hecho del ingreso y egreso con valijas del departamento, en el resto de los aspectos fue todo maravilloso y Andrés fue muy generoso con nosotros, definitivamente recomiendo alquilar este departamento a todo aquel que quiera visitar NY y manejarse caminando o en subterráneo.</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>40088076</td><td>7/28/2015</td><td>32153907</td><td>Evelyn</td><td>This apartment was PERFECT!!!! First off, the location can't be beat. It's close to everything a visitor to NYC needs. It was my mother (75), myself (50) and my daughter (16). I mention ages because I didn't want my mother to have to endure a 3 to 4 floor walk up and my daughter left the apartment, camera in hand, to explore the surrounding neighborhood without me worrying. A block away is the Amish market (excellent grocery). Two to three blocks-several subway and bus lines going up and downtown and Times Square.  15-20 minute walks to the Circle line, Central Park, MOMA, Rockefeller Center. Also a bike share right across the street-I rode the bike down the Westside highway to the beginning of the Highline, walked thru it then biked home.

Leiligheten var hyggelig, men jeg likte ikke at vi vasket opp i samme vask som vi vasket hender og pusset tenner i. Veldig uhygenisk. Det er svært lytt fra etasjen over og ned til utleieleiligheten. Spesielt når noen løper og hopper eller går med sko. </td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>49830508</td><td>10/6/2015</td><td>9078451</td><td>Woldy</td><td>Lila was a lovely host!

Lila is welcoming, helpful and really informative about all things NY. The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay. It's also convenient for getting to the subways. There's plenty of interesting places to eat within walking distance. We'd be happy to stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>50292214</td><td>10/11/2015</td><td>488788</td><td>Lavinia</td><td>This apartment is so ADORABLE!!! The moment that I stepped into the room, I only wish that I had booked it for longer!!! Everything was clean and organized. Lila was extremely friendly and sweet- she gave us a tour of the apartment and also gave use suggestions for dinner! Our half marathon race on Saturday started late and we were running late for checking out. She let us to stay after 11am so we could shower before departure! </td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>50742021</td><td>10/14/2015</td><td>34621204</td><td>Sara</td><td>The place is situated close to subway, restaurants and bodegas.

Such a change of pace from the midtown mayhem to quiet, leafy, brownstone streets. The apartment itself is gorgeous and felt so spacious and inviting. We were also lucky enough to enjoy warmer Fall weather and make use of the outside deck. Perfect for some late afternoon wine and cheese!\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>51285845</td><td>10/19/2015</td><td>12992979</td><td>Pamela</td><td>We loved this apartment! In town for a wedding in Williamsburg, we wanted to stay a bit off the beaten path and this apartment was terrific. We were able to easily access nearby restaurants and cafes and enjoyed walking everywhere during our free time. Great weather afforded us the opportunity to have breakfast on the deck which boasts amazing morning sun. Lila provided a really helpful ‘welcome’ book for our stay (which we referenced multiple times!) and there were clear labels on all lights and appliances for ease of use. While our schedules prevented us from saying “Hello!” in person, Lila was only a message away if we needed anything which made us feel even more at ease. The apartment was clean, quiet, and a perfect fit for our weekend away from home. We would definitely stay again! Thanks, Lila! </td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>52390352</td><td>10/29/2015</td><td>28552802</td><td>Sabine</td><td>Lila was a perfect host, very very friendly and helpful.

I used the apartment as a grounding point for a self-designed writer's retreat. It was perfect. Lila was so kind and generous with her time and recommendations. By day 2 I had to force myself to take a walk because I realized I didn't have to go beyond a 3 block radius to have everything I need. The apartment itself is well laid out with calm and yet homey design. The light it receives is beautiful all day long. Plus the neighborhood is awesome. Pratt and Fort Greene are all an easy walk away and you have all the restaurants and cafes you need right out the door. I also really enjoyed my class at Dou Yoga around the corner. I would highly recommend this place for a single person or a couple. If you will be arriving to New York via Penn Station: It is such an easy commute and Lila was very flexible with my moving arrival time. I can't wait to make a return trip myself.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>56178132</td><td>12/10/2015</td><td>8258300</td><td>Brigitte</td><td>Vielen Dank Lila für die wunderschöne Zeit in Ihrem Apartment.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>56291530</td><td>12/11/2015</td><td>3454244</td><td>Andrew</td><td>What an amazing apartment in such an incredible location. Lila's brownstone is in the heart of Brooklyn, close to everywhere I wanted to be. She gave great recommendations on where to go (speedy romeo's was no joke!) and she was so hospitable. If you want to stay in Brooklyn and have an authentic experience with a real new yorker, stay at Lila's. \t</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>56591810</td><td>12/15/2015</td><td>3526408</td><td>Stephen</td><td>The solitude, quiet neighborhood, minimal street traffic, proximity to fine dining areas, parks, and public transportation make this an excellent choice for lodging in Brooklyn. The apartment was easily accessed with flexible accommodation by our gracious host. We hope to return in the near future.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>57003686</td><td>12/21/2015</td><td>26366792</td><td>Alistair</td><td>The apartment in Brooklyn was excellent, as photographed and described.

Lila was so kind and patient to help us solve all the problems. We stayed in Lila's place for 5 days. We took train from Boston to NY and got delayed for almost 2 hours but Lila was still very nice and greeted us. Definitely will come back!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>57884254</td><td>12/30/2015</td><td>6888244</td><td>Asma</td><td>Nice and quiet neighbourhood and lovely flat. Downside which I knew about from reading other reviews but didn't think through enough, was that there is no kitchen sink and so we had to use the one in the shower room. This put us off cooking in some ways. Wonder if with the price per night charged, whether it might be nice to invest in a dishwasher for guests to make their stay truly comfortable. </td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>58489366</td><td>1/3/2016</td><td>1769168</td><td>Adam</td><td>The apartment was lovely, spacious and well stocked.

I have nothing but positive things to say. </td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>60023287</td><td>1/18/2016</td><td>663946</td><td>Daniel</td><td>Lila was a great host! She made me feel very welcome and walked me through a list of nearby restaurants and had lots of helpful tips for my stay on hand. The apartment itself was bright and quiet with lots of attention to detail: Freshly ground coffee and tea, even milk in the fridge! There was also a little closet with hairdryer, iron, and an umbrella which came in very helpful on a rainy day. I would gladly stay again!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>60415223</td><td>1/23/2016</td><td>2085892</td><td>Jacqueline And Joseph</td><td>Lila was a perfect host. She made me feel so welcome, from the moment I arrived to when I left. The apartment is the bottom floor of a brownstone on a historic block - a total dream! What's more - it's beautifully and thoughtfully furnished, with everything you need for your stay, including the ability to control the thermostat yourself (so nice during a particularly chilly week in New York). Thanks Lila!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>60727031</td><td>1/26/2016</td><td>115045</td><td>Sherri</td><td>My parents stayed at Lila's apartment for three days. The experience was wonderful from start to finish. Lila was very responsive, answered all of our questions, and even met my parents on their arrival to the apartment. The space is a beautiful parlor apartment in a historic brownstone, with high ceilings and simple, stylish decor. It is very well appointed. The bed was especially comfortable. There is a large outdoor deck for enjoyment, and there is tons of natural light flooding the space. Lila continued to be available, responsive, and kind during their stay. I cannot recommend this apartment more for a stay in Brooklyn. Thanks Lila!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>61056252</td><td>1/31/2016</td><td>2707531</td><td>Miranda</td><td>We had the most wonderful time at Lila's place. Peaceful Parlor it was indeed! The airy and light apartment was perfectly equipped and elegantly designed. There was a grand mix of retro modern furniture with period antiques and really fantastic art. We were close to everything, including places to eat, have coffee, meet for wine, eat pizza or fine dine. We had plenty of privacy and the apartment was surprisingly very quiet. Lila was the perfect host by greeting us, explaining the most important things about our stay, and then we never saw her again. She has a friendly air about her for sure and we look forward to renting her peaceful parlor apartment again one day! Oh and I forgot to mention that there is a private deck on the outside of the back of apartment that must be so fun to use in the summertime. Thank you Lila, for the beautiful vacation spot. </td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>61751783</td><td>2/8/2016</td><td>11226609</td><td>Jorrit</td><td>Handing over key, instructions etc. were great.

She communicated everything we would need to know to be comfortable in the apartment and gave us great tips for doing things in the neighborhood. The location could not be better and the apartment is adorable and super clean. Also very well stocked with toiletries and coffee. We will definitely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>63749831</td><td>2/26/2016</td><td>49339118</td><td>Ashley</td><td>We used Lila's beautiful home for a photoshoot. Lila was incredibly accommodating and kind. Her apartment was absolutely perfect for the aesthetic we were looking for. In addition to it being a lovely space, there were also tons of places to eat in the area, cute coffee shops, beautiful brownstones. The absolute perfect dreamy romantic New York location.

Clinton Hill is a fab spot in Brooklyn... a gorgeous, leafy, peaceful residential area with great restaurants and bars [and great coffee!] right on your doorstep. Our favourite was Locanda Vini & Olii which is right on the corner of the street - amazing food & wine and brilliant staff. Beautiful parks and gardens are close by too - just a short stroll away. Everything you could ask for! The apartment itself far exceeded our expectations... it is even more beautiful in reality than it looks online [which is saying something]. Lila has incredible taste and truly you couldn't want for anything more in terms of comfort. Brilliant bed and linen and stylish furnishings. And, if the season is on your side, the outdoor deck is a bonus too! The subway is close by and an easy ride into Manhattan. We even walked from the apartment into town, quite a few times, over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. Lila herself was a great host and very responsive with any communication. Honestly, unless you are hell-bent on staying in the thick of it, which we were not, you won't do better than this apartment. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.

Es una persona amable y dispuesta. El apartamento es cómodo y no se oyen ruidos. La zona es segura y pintoresca. El subte está a unas pocas cuadras y se tarda entre 20 y 30 minutos en cruzar a Manhattan. La cocina es cómoda. El baño es reducido pero los espacios han sido bien aprovechados. El sofá cama es muy práctico, si viajan con niños es una buena opción. Nuestra experiencia fue muy buena y la recomendaríamos.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>167680799</td><td>7/7/2017</td><td>132061184</td><td>Jerry</td><td>Wonderful Stay.  Lila's apartment is very comfortable, appropriately furnished, and exceptionally clean. We enjoyed the deck in the morning for coffee. It is centrally located well within walking distance for restaurants and grocery shopping.  I would definitely return to this property and highly recommend it to others for short term travel arrangements when visiting Brooklyn.  </td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>169747374</td><td>7/13/2017</td><td>5142465</td><td>Heather</td><td>Lila's apartment was a very welcome respite from the busy and noisy area of Mid Town which was the first half of our visit to New York.  We enjoyed 'living' in a characteristic Brooklyn neighbourhood and with the close proximity to two subway lines and the fabulous neighbourhood cafes and restaurants that were so close, the apartment was the perfect place for us to relax and enjoy the peacefulness.  Lila was extremely quick to respond to my questions and was very accommodating with suggestions of activities etc.  The Welcome Book was full of information and ideas as well as the excellent Brooklyn guide that was also provided and helped with our planning of what to see and do.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>174282324</td><td>7/25/2017</td><td>1134109</td><td>Veerle</td><td>We enjoyed our stay at Lila's place.

The apartment is a large partitioned section of the parlor floor with high ceilings and great mid-century furnishings. The toilet and shower areas are very small and the only sink is in the shower room so dishes are a bit of a challenge but otherwise, the place is spacious. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>181381409</td><td>8/12/2017</td><td>122158560</td><td>Takashi</td><td>We had a wonderful day. A comfortable bed. Kitchen necessary for cooking. Quiet environment. Balcony where sunrise and squirrel will come. A little inconvenience in living is certainly a thing in life. However, more pleasure is felt during stay. Rather, it was a room that made me feel like coming home to be relieved for the active day.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>184410372</td><td>8/19/2017</td><td>20035231</td><td>Vanessa</td><td>Location, cleanliness, convenience, amenities, Lila's place is the perfect Brooklyn home away from home. The neighborhood was incredible, so many fantastic restaurants, local watering holes, and shops. We really enjoyed Clinton Hill and our friends who live in Jersey/Queens who came to visit us fell in love with the neighborhood also, now they all want to move Clinton Hill! ;) There is no bedroom, it's like a studio setup which is fine and very NYC, however just good to know ahead of time. Also the bathroom is separated into a toilet behind 1 door and separate area for shower/sink behind another door. Both were tiny but for NYC standards we totally get it and it was not an issue at all. The back patio really adds to the element of the space, it was so peaceful and truly helped us appreciate all Brooklyn and borough life has to offer! We will be back :)</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>187237563</td><td>8/26/2017</td><td>20001944</td><td>Dominic</td><td>Lila's place is an oasis of calm in the city. The beds were super comfortable (even the sofa bed -what a revelation!) and the neighbourhood quiet but with unexpected interesting bars, restaurants and stores with equally interesting owners around every corner. Some days I wished I didn't have to go in to Manhattan so I could explore further. Lila's recommendations for local places to eat were spot on and  she was incredibly responsive and helpful. I'll be back - to coin a phrase... Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>188512962</td><td>8/29/2017</td><td>14521911</td><td>Philippe</td><td>Spacious, well lit, and beautifully furnished space, located super close to trains into Manhattan and in a great walkable neighborhood.

The high, bright walls and large windows make for a restful, mind clearing space. It was very clean and easy to keep clean. The neighborhood has nearly anything you could want within a 15 minute walk in one direction or another. Very safe. My favorite feature of this rental was the bedding. High quality materials and thoughtful placement. I slept really well. Thanks, Lila!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>196271954</td><td>9/22/2017</td><td>119209565</td><td>Colin</td><td>Lila's place is spacious, comfortable and very neat and clean and has all necessary bathroom and sleeping conveniences.  Reasonable size fridge and kitchenette with small table make self catering of basic meals convenient.  Difficult to do full meal cooking due to  shared bathroom and kitchen basin and lack of oven.  Lila's place is located short walk to C line station to Manhattan and in a leafy, quiet street.  We would not hesitate to recommend Lila's place to other guests.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>198182911</td><td>9/28/2017</td><td>11478231</td><td>Rémi</td><td>Hi Lila,\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>199965428</td><td>10/3/2017</td><td>3953</td><td>Lynn</td><td>We had a great time staying at Lylus place. It is a wonderful location and just steps away from great bars, cafés and hip restaurants with great food. It’s a beautiful tree-lined Brown Stone Street in Clinton Hill with easy access to the subway. The house was extremely clean with a great deck off of the kitchen. We slept very well in a comfortable bed and enjoyed preparing food in the morning before we went out and enjoyed the neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>200509853</td><td>10/5/2017</td><td>28592262</td><td>Nancy</td><td>Lila's place was as advertised and utterly charming.

The neighborhood is quiet but really close to restaurants, bars, and public transportation to get you around. Plus Lila does a great job with recommendations! Her details made our day!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>203715140</td><td>10/15/2017</td><td>13030309</td><td>Lisa</td><td>Still on cloud 9 from our wonderful stay in Lila's beautiful place. Can't wait to return! Our favorite feature was the outdoor deck for coffee in the morning. I loved the original art on the walls, and the light-filled spaciousness of the apt. Walking around the neighborhood was a sybarite's dream. Anything we needed was within a 3 block radius. Thank you Lila. You're a lovely host, and a gracious spirit. See you again soon!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>204314619</td><td>10/17/2017</td><td>23194571</td><td>Gillian</td><td>Great stay!</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>206261431</td><td>10/24/2017</td><td>5712563</td><td>Barbara</td><td>Eine schöne Wohnung, sehr gut und ruhig gelegen in einem alten Brownstone-Haus in Brooklyn.

The high ceilings makes the flat feel so much bigger than it really is, and Lila and Paul have done a stellar job at creating a comfortable and attractive environment. There was excellent communication with the hosts and speaking as a personal lover of label makers, I was very pleased to find that all the switches were clearly identified. Some might be surprised to find the only sink in the bathroom, but it was such a small detail I wouldn't really call it an inconvenience. The neighborhood is great and close to transportation. All in all, you won't be disappointed with your stay.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>211822567</td><td>11/14/2017</td><td>64035156</td><td>Jamie</td><td>We had a great stay at Lila & Paul’s place.  We come to Brooklyn often and will definitely stay here again. Like other guests have said, this is not a one bedroom but more like a studio with a separate kitchen.  However the main room is so large that we were able to put both of our small children to bed and stay up (quietly) without disturbing them.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>213525174</td><td>11/21/2017</td><td>86058420</td><td>Dave</td><td>Great flat in a excellent location.

Lila was quick to respond and answer any questions we had, their place was impeccable, smart, and stylishly appointed. Getting in and out was a breeze, and the value was excellent. I highly recommend staying here if you're in the mood for an authentic local NYC experience.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>218410033</td><td>12/12/2017</td><td>26912530</td><td>John W</td><td>We always have a great time when we stay at Lila's and Paul's. It's a lively neighborhood with great restaurant choices, but very quiet for NYC with little street noise. Yet it's easy to get in and out of Manhattan on the C train. The space, as always, was extraordinarily clean. And Lila is so thoughtful with all the snacks and wine and goodies. Couldn't recommend it more highly.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>225179298</td><td>1/5/2018</td><td>12483871</td><td>Cindy</td><td>The apartment is lovely and spacious.

The location was perfect for us -   quiet street, quiet unit, close to our daughter's apartment, close to the Claussen subway stop, close to good restaurants, small Bodegas, and an easy walk to our favorite coffee shop 'Choice'. The photos on the Airbnb site were very accurate.  As other reviewers have noted, and as can be seen on the photos, there is not a sink in the kitchen, only a small sink in the bathroom connected to the kitchen. Takes some getting used to, but not a problem at all. We definitely look forward to staying there again.</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>244377474</td><td>3/18/2018</td><td>101885780</td><td>Lily</td><td>My parents stayed here for the weekend.

Het huis ligt in een rustig deel van Brooklyn waar het veilig en vriendelijk voelde met om de hoek de nodige voorzieningen zoals een goede supermarkt, een drankwinkel met lekkere wijnen (Leon & Sol) en een heel goede broodjes zaak (Gordon Savory). Er is een metro om de hoek die je zo naar Manhattan brengt. Onze ervaring was dat de reis meestal zo’n 45 minuten duurde van deur naar deur naar een plek in Manhattan of van Manhattan terug naar het huis. Het was prettig om na de drukte van het centrum in het idyllische en rustige wijkje terug te komen. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2323714</td><td>268974542</td><td>5/26/2018</td><td>121415170</td><td>Robin</td><td>This is a WOW!

Their dog Zuzu is adorable, and the quietest dog I have ever seen. The neighborhood is a bit shabby, but Bushwick is supposed to be the next trendy area in Brooklyn, so it can only get better. It felt very safe too. The subway is only 5 minutes away, and the trains take you to Time Square in less than 20mn. The place is very cute and clean, but I do not recommend it to people with bad knees since the ladder that leads to the bed is very steep and the steps are far apart. Also the sleeping space is a bit cramped, so if you are the kind of person who likes spreading their things, you will not feel comfortable. Other than that, if you are young and traveling light, I totally recommend Shalyn and Christopher's place!</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>18791663</td><td>9/1/2014</td><td>7028093</td><td>Michelle</td><td>Shalyn and Christopher were very accommodating and welcoming hosts. Their space was clean, and while the climb to the top of the loft space was a little scary the first night, we were pros at climbing up and down by our last day. The neighbourhood itself is a little sketchy, but we never felt unsafe walking to and from the subway station (which was a super close 5 min walk away!). For anyone concerned about their dog Zuzu, she is very quiet and sweet. Overall I would definitely recommend staying at Shalyn and Christopher's place. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>20196848</td><td>9/25/2014</td><td>20443521</td><td>Petra</td><td>I think I could describe this in one sentence: Wonderful first experience.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>21129603</td><td>10/12/2014</td><td>13498770</td><td>Margarethe</td><td>Amazing place to stay!

All good things in once. Both the apartment and the host are very warm and very welcoming. The neighborhood is quiet. We felt always safe even when we got back late in the night. Just 5 min to the subway and 15 min to Manhatten. We can't say enough good about our stay!!!

The space was tidy and roomy, with a comfortable loft space, plenty of work space, and extra towels and blankets galore. And there was always a pot of coffee brewing in the morning, a godsend for a caffeine addict like myself. Being a few block walk away from the JMZ train stop was so convenient since I was bustling back and forth between Manhattan and Brooklyn during my trip.

So if we ever come back to NY we will definetely stay there again! </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>32823112</td><td>5/22/2015</td><td>12948811</td><td>Joanne</td><td>It was really nice to stay with Chris as he gives us space and recommends us different places to eat and go to. He made us some chocolate brownies the night before we left, really nice! The location is near the station and convenient to go to Manhattan area. Even though it feels a little unsafe and dark at night for 2 girl, but all is well. The place is clean and Chris is really friendly and always looks out for us. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>33443905</td><td>5/28/2015</td><td>30793144</td><td>Onelica</td><td>Christopher's place was nice and comfortable.

We recommend staying at Christopher's if you're coming to New York. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>35376291</td><td>6/18/2015</td><td>28637476</td><td>Elisabeth</td><td>Thank you, Christopher, for having been the best host. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>36177464</td><td>6/26/2015</td><td>28955880</td><td>Fionnuala</td><td>Christopher's flat is in a great location between two metro lines, meaning you can get into Manhattan in about 15 minutes. Christopher gave great recommendations on local restaurants and cafes. Zuzu is the most adorable dog and is no trouble at all. The stairs are a little creaky up to the nook and the mattress isn't the most comfortable. Christopher wasn't there for much of our stay but his friend Putnam came bye to check we were okay and to walk Zuzu. Communication was great and I can definitely recommend  the flat. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>36956569</td><td>7/3/2015</td><td>32523499</td><td>Agathe</td><td>C'était la première fois que nous allions aux USA et notre séjour chez Christopher s'est très bien passé. Christopher est quelqu'un de très attentionné envers ses hôtes et nous préparait de bons petits déjeuners et était également toujours à notre écoute, nous donnant de bons conseils sur les lieux à visiter. Nous avons eu de très bonnes conversations avec lui, et Christopher est quelqu'un de très patient. Enfin, c'est quelqu'un de très souriant et joyeux :) ! Autrement dit, nous avons passé un super séjour !!</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>38277260</td><td>7/14/2015</td><td>2751216</td><td>Sarah</td><td>My cousin and I stayed at Christopher's place, so we used both the couch and the loft bed. Both were very comfortable. The location is really convenient and the apartment was incredibly clean & well maintained. Christopher was kind enough to offer conversation, tea, and snacks to share .On top of that, Zsu Zsu is the sweetest & quietest pup ever.  All in all, our trip was a total success and a lot of that is thanks to Christopher. Expect me back the next time I'm in the city!</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>39158490</td><td>7/21/2015</td><td>32050598</td><td>Sarah</td><td>Christopher is awesome, he was the perfect host and made us feel completely at home. He gave us space to do our own thing but also spent time with us and gave us loads of advice about the area and what we should do while we were in New York. The description of his apartment was completely accurate, it was so cosy and unique. And Zuzu is the best dog/co-host we have ever met. There`s two subway stations really close to Christopher's apartment which makes it easy to get from Brooklyn to Manhattan and there's plenty of places to eat and drink in the area. We really enjoyed spending time with Christopher, he made us laugh and made us breakfast, we'd definitely recommend staying with him. God bless the chickpea. </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>40089622</td><td>7/28/2015</td><td>19799609</td><td>John</td><td>Christopher was a true gentleman and a great host to have for me and my girlfriend's stay in Brooklyn New York. He made us feel very welcome from the get go, giving us perfect directions from JFK airport to his place, and met us at his place at the exact planned time to let us in and give us keys. Throughout the trip he gave us privacy and tended to his own business which was nice. Me and my girlfriend did get a chance to get to know him a bit over breakfast's he made us, he even took us out for coffee at Lil Skip's on our last day for a  classic Brooklyn coffee experience! He's an interesting guy and a fellow artist like my girlfriend and I so we clicked well. His place is as advertised and it was really cozy and well kept. How often do you get to sleep on a handmade treehouse-like bed in a Brooklyn apartment? He had great recommendations for food and drink places, especially Mr Kiwi's which is a grocery store two minutes away, which saved us a lot of money over the trip. We were allowed to use his kitchen freely and enjoyed homemade breakfasts every morning with coffee in mason jars that he provided. His dog Zuzu was very adorable and friendly and made our trip even more pleasant. Chris's apartment is less than 5 minutes to the JMZ train which made all of New York accessible. The ride into manhattan was only 15 minutes. Bushwick felt very safe and we never had issues during our stay, even when we were out until 2 in the morning one night. We would happily stay at Chris's again and we are never staying in a hotel again. Airbnb is the way to go! I encourage you to book with Chris if you plan to travel to Brooklyn, he won't disappoint.</td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>43510396</td><td>8/20/2015</td><td>13338299</td><td>Annette</td><td>Christopher is such a great guy! He really made my boyfriend and I feel welcome in his home. He is very easy-going and friendly, and he has a very cute and lovely dog which we came to be very good friends with. He was busy with work but still he found time to hang with us and cook breakfast for us. His home is just as it is shown on the pictures - cozy, clean and warm. It is very easy to go from his apartment to Manhattan, and we especially liked spending time in Williamsburg which his home is very close to. We can absolutely recommend other to live at Christopher's! </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>45399820</td><td>9/2/2015</td><td>5895308</td><td>Hänski</td><td>Christopher, Zuzu and his beautiful little cozy place in Brooklyn made our first time in New York an awesome experience !! The place looks exactly like in the pictures and we really liked hanging out there. The area is really vibrant since bushwick is an upcoming neighborhood with a cool flair to it. Cool Bars, awesome restaurants and cute little cafes are all in walking distance and make you totally forget about manhattan. Getting to manhattan is really easy though since there a two jmz train stations around the corner. So you can get there basically any day- or nighttime ! Williamsburg with its endless opportunities to hang out, shop or drink is also right around the corner. Christopher as a host was just the best. He totally made us feel welcome at his place !! communication beforehand was also really good and easy as well. He sometimes even made breakfast for us in the morning. When we came home after a long trip of sightseeing in manhattan we sometimes just hung out together with a couple of beers, talking about basically everything. It felt more like friends visiting a friend. I can totally recommend this place on every level. So thank you again Christopher for this great experience ! Oh yeah and Zuzu is really just the best =) </td></tr><tr><td>2325144</td><td>46426047</td><td>9/10/2015</td><td>42777496</td><td>Elia</td><td>As first experience with airbnb it was amazing!

But the neighborhood is something I wanted to explore - close to Bushwick and Williamsburg and full of arts, laid-back Brooklyn feel. It can get quiet during night time but I felt safe the whole time. Barbara is very easy to communicate with. She keeps the place tidy and is very considerate.

However, if one discounts the fact that one is paying, staying at the Heras' Washington Heights apartment is like visiting your Latino relatives--Ecuadorian American--that you like a lot who put you in their college-age daughter's bedroom and shower you with grace and good will.

The apartment is close to the subway station and bus stops, so it is really easy to go to downtown and other places as well. She lives in the 5th floor and I had two big and heavy luggage. They helped me to take the luggage upstairs and then downstairs when I left the house. So, if you don't mind carrying/lifting some weight it is no problem to stay at their place.

We took advantage of the location to explore Prospect Park and the Botanical Garden, which are also nearby and really very nice. Helena was always available and very responsive to any questions and inquiries we had. Helena, also graciously allowed us to get into the apartment earlier than the published check in time so that we could drop our bags and start our day.

Di tre cose però dobbiamo lamentarci: nell'appartamento di Rebeca, in cui abbiamo soggiornato per una settimana, non vi era alcuno spazio per riporre i nostri abiti; dopo qualche giorno sì è verificata l'ostruzione dello scarico del lavabo e della tazza del water (per nostra comodità abbiamo risolto autonomamente il problema, dovuto a una scarsa manutenzione degli impianti). Infine, il grado di pulizia generale dell'appartamento lascia piuttosto a desiderare. L'impianto di riscaldamento funziona, ma è piuttosto rumoroso, anche se crediamo che il problema dipenda dalle condizioni complessive dell'edificio. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2333141</td><td>59271360</td><td>1/9/2016</td><td>22762738</td><td>Celia</td><td>The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival.

The apartment is in close distance to the subway and there are many stores and deli's close by. The train is one stop away from a station that connects you to many trains and the ride to Manhattan wasn't difficult. The apartment itself is a wonderful and very vibrant 1 bedroom apartment with a ton of natural light and a well equipped kitchen. Rebeca has decorated it very nicely and it felt very welcoming and comforting.  The bedroom is quite large for NYC and although there was only 1 real queen sized bed, the air mattresses and beanbag were great alternatives and quite comfortable. Rebeca and Xavier made the key exchange very easy and were helpful with any needs or questions we had.

The place was perfect for our needs, close to the Subway station, excellent food at Sylvia's a short walk away and despite the odd hours we were keeping, getting up at 4am or coming back at 6am our host was very understanding. The street itself was beautiful and tree lined and we did enjoy having access to the back garden area even though our schedule gave us very little time to enjoy it. Brenda and her daughter were the perfect hosts, checking in from time to time, providing bottled water, which we were very grateful for as it was so hot the week we were there. The air conditioning units helped to keep out oasis cool and comfortable. They also respected our privacy and made sure to text or ring the doorbell before entering. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here if you are planning an extended stay and I do hope to be able to visit and stay again in the future.

I stayed for a month and I really enjoyed it. Yacine and Brenda were great hosts, always reachable and always willing to help or to check if everything was ok, which is very convenient. The apt is very spacious, clean, comfortable, uncluttered, with big closets, quiet,... I can't think of anything negative. Bed was comfy, tv with cable, good wifi, lots of sheets and towels, kitchen had everything you need to cook a decent meal, bathroom is small but shower was good and I had enough space for my toiletries. I didn't used the patio because of the weather but I'm sure in the summer it should be a great place to hang out. The street is lovely, and neighborhood is very live. Close to the subway, a supermarket open almost until midnight, nice restaurants, shops and 5 minute walk to the busiest street of Harlem, 125th, near the Apollo Theatre and other subway lines. Great location, great host, great apt. Perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>2334411</td><td>149457924</td><td>5/4/2017</td><td>23294446</td><td>Евгения</td><td>Отличная квартира. Соответствует фотографиям.

Her apartment is located in a lovely area full of restaurants, cafes and supermarkets. It's also very close to a metro station, so you can commute everywhere. For me the location was perfect, and I would definitely stay here again. During my stay Véronique invited me to meet her friends, and we had a lovely time at different venues and restaurants. Even if Véronique is very inclusive she also respects your private life. The room I rented had everything I needed, a comfortable bed, a hanger and a drawer for my clothes, and a desk where I could study. My stay at Véronique's certainly raised my New York experience to another level beyond Times Square and tourist traps. I’m so glad I found her on airbnb!</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>12627589</td><td>5/6/2014</td><td>9095587</td><td>Christoph</td><td>Veronique was a very kind and friendly host, and her cat is indeed adorable!

The surrounding area is quite multicultural and alive, I never had a problem coming back alone late in the night. The metro is 4 minutes away so it's very convenient. About the host: Veronique is a very nice host, she gave me lots of useful advice for visiting NYC, and she also lends you lots of maps and other useful things. I had a great time in NYC, I was very busy so we did not meet many times, but I would recommend staying at her place. The good-sized private room has everything you need: a comfortable bed, a desk, mirror etc. You probably might need to be comfortable with cats as her nice black cat comes around sometimes and wants to play, but for me this was nice and not a problem. Afterall my judgement is positive and I would definitely recommend staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>15336102</td><td>7/7/2014</td><td>16199728</td><td>Poppo</td><td>Great place to stay in NYC.

She went to work each morning before I got up and I returned after she went to bed.   She was friendly and helpful, gave me some suggestions of a museum and places to eat in the neighborhood. Even at my check out to next host (couldn't stay all my days due to another guest's prior booking) she said to contact her if I need to know something about the city.  She gave me a tour of her place and wifi password upon my arrival.  Licorice the cat is very friendly and will sleep next to you in the morning if you leave your door cracked. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>21282232</td><td>10/14/2014</td><td>19468711</td><td>Marion</td><td>Véronique est une personne accueillante.

The apartment was very cosy, clean and warm (highly recommended for a winter stay!), comfy loft bed with plenty of space in the room. Veronique was very accommodating and willing to provide info and recommendations on the city/sights. Veronique also has a cutie cat - liquorice ('Réglisse') who will sneak into your room if the door isn't shut! You also don't have to worry about making too much noise, as rooms are at opposite ends if the apartment.

Location is great; the apartment is a couple blocks from the subway, and is located in East Village (great for people who enjoy bars). Keep in mind, the apartment is on the 5th floor and there are no elevators. It wasn't an issue for me. As other reviewers have stated, there is a very friendly and affectionate cat in the apartment. Great value for the price, much better than staying at a hostel or cheap hotel. I would stay here again if I needed a place in NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>23902224</td><td>12/14/2014</td><td>23240178</td><td>Lionel</td><td>Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans le quartier de Véronique qui nous a été de bon conseil pour découvrir la ville.\n</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>24023149</td><td>12/17/2014</td><td>22351908</td><td>Katie</td><td>Veronique was wonderful!

Also loved the Lower East Side with cool places to have a meal or drinks. The apartment is not big, but it has everything you need for a solo stay. Also, Veronique went out of her way to make sure I had a great time, from giving me advice to actually showing me around town. Since the heating can't be turned off untill May 15th, it was pretty hot but the fans that were everywhere made it a comfortable stay anyway. Would definitely recommend staying here!  </td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>28566216</td><td>3/26/2015</td><td>11498390</td><td>Roland</td><td>Zunächst einmal war die Kommunkation vor der Anreise mit Veronique sehr verlässlich und informativ.

You don't have a view form the room window but anyway, who needs it when NYC is so close, waiting for exploration? In the nearest neighborhood you will find a lot of small cute restaurants - pizza, Indian, cafes and many more, as well as shops and subway which is 3 blocks away.

Véronique was so kind and accepted my quite late check-in. The room is a nice size for NY City and bed felt very comfortable. As I was traveling super light, Véronique offered to me toiletry basics I am very grateful for. The bathroom space is very small and I managed to bump into things very easely:) With that said I would definitely recommend this place to stay in! Véronique suggested to me an amazing breakfast place just a short walk from her home, which was one of the best in my life! Ask her for that if you want to spend a great day without thinking of food!:) Thank you, Véronique!</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>52230707</td><td>10/27/2015</td><td>9242052</td><td>Leon</td><td>Affordable space in NYC</td></tr><tr><td>2339096</td><td>53179127</td><td>11/6/2015</td><td>4761963</td><td>Julien</td><td>J'ai passé un très bon séjour dans l'appartement de Veronique qui est très accueillante et de bon conseils.

Véronique herself is very welcoming and friendly. While I was there, I noticed that she had a book on Degas, and when I expressed excitement about it, she told me that I could have it. On top of all this, I left some dishes in the sink one morning and apologized about it, because I didn't know where the dish soap, but she said she didn't mind doing the dishes and really preferred to.

I only saw Véronique the day I checked in and she is lovely. We were both a bit frazzled as it was the day after the 2016 Election. I felt welcomed and understood. I am not a fan of cats (at all) but I loved Véronique's cat; she's very sweet.

If you want somewhere spacious, modern and hotel-like, then this is not for you; but Veronique makes this clear from the listing and the message I received before booking. This place really has character; I felt like I was staying with a friend, living in a really cool little corner of New York which is full of history. Veronique was friendly and had good recommendations for what to do in the local area, and it was lovely to have a little chat with her at the end of a long day exploring.

The place is really close to a metro station that took us to most of the touristic places of the city without changing the line; F or J lines took us to both Uptown and Downtown very fast, Little Italy and Chinatown are walking-distance and the Williamsburg Bridge is just a couple blocks away, so you can walk directly to Brooklyn's heart.  There are A LOT of great places to eat (Kat's Deli is just about few blocks away from the apartment!!) and for coffee lovers, there's a Blue Bottle Coffee shop right next to the building entrance.

She was flexible about check in time, was very clear about house rules, and was available for any questions we had.

The desk gave me the perfect space to do some work on my laptop during my visit. Very close to subway, so getting around is very easy and convenient as well. Lots of places to eat nearby!

There is a loft bed, a small but functional bathroom, and a walk through kitchen. Perhaps if there was more than just myself it would have felt cramped, but I just felt cozy. The stairs up to the apartment itself are tough with heavy luggage, and I would recommend to travel lightly here. The location was phenomenal!

The only downside to the apartment is that the walls are remarkably thin so I could pretty much hear everything his roommate was doing and I felt bad waking up in the morning if he was still sleeping or coming back after a night out. Otherwise, it was a great space and a fun neighborhood to spend a couple weeks. </td></tr><tr><td>2346106</td><td>10799158</td><td>3/8/2014</td><td>10183472</td><td>Marion</td><td>We didn't get to meet will, but he has been really helpful and great!

Will is a very easy and communicative host, and though I didn't get to meet him he was always quick to respond to any messages on Airbnb, text or email. The neighborhood of the apartment is fantastic. There is everything you could possibly need in a three block radius (like you would expect most places in NYC) but it's also chilled out and neighborly. You can take the G train--though only convenient on the weekdays, or the ferry--which is a beautiful ride and pretty quick! The loft itself is very spacious, probably with most everything you would need to cook (though I didn't); there is also a pool table to use. Will and Rick, Will's roommate, keep everything very clean and tidy. The room is very large, especially by NYC standards, has comfy bed, desk, and lounging area. The only drawback was that the walls are really paper thin -- though to be honest since Rick works nights and I left early in the AM most days, it didn't bother me. Both Rick and Will were really nice and accommodating to everything I needed, I would definitely stay here again if I ever fine myself on a solo trip to NYC. Thanks Will!</td></tr><tr><td>2346106</td><td>13968062</td><td>6/9/2014</td><td>6521193</td><td>Terry And Piper</td><td>Will was very fast to communicate.

We did find a remote for a small air unit that hangs from the ceiling but it took several hours for the temp to get to a comfortable level. The bed was comfy and clean, The shared bathroom was clean but cluttered.. The loft was very noisy the night we stayed. There's a door that seems like it's right on the other side of the wall where the bed is located. It slammed shut five or six times during the night. Last but not least, it was a rainy night and there were at least two leaks in the ceiling that I could hear.

She greeted us when we arrived and gave us all the information we needed about the flat as well as some inside info of the area. She's a very nice person and made us feel very welcome! The bedroom is bigger than the impression you get from the picture and the bed is really comfy. The flat is the optimal starting point to explore Williamsburg, and very in tone with the image of the place, and also gives easy access to Manhattan by the L or J train, depending on where you're going. We were in New York for a week and stayed at Nora's place for the last few days. It felt great to be a place where we could cook our dinner and have breakfast, as New York is quite expensive. However, there's great eating places in the area, even for a gluten allergic vegetarian as myself.

During our stay, we were not allowed to access to the wash room but Ruby took our clothes to wash and dry for us. The place is in the middle of 2 subway stations (3 lines). Walking 0.6 miles to the subway is not a big deal for us because we like to walk. Overall, we like her place. Thank you Ruby for being a very good host for us. </td></tr><tr><td>2349715</td><td>30337949</td><td>4/20/2015</td><td>30660541</td><td>Kara</td><td>This was an amazing experience!

One night it took 40 minutes to find a parking spot. I suggest not moving your car once you get there if possible and just walking/using public transportation. That was no reflection on the place or host but I'm assuming just part of being in such a huge city. Ruby was fabulous. She was so helpful and accommodating from the time I inquired about the apartment until after check out. She made us feel very welcomed.

We were provided with a parking space in an enclosed garage which was very convenient. Faruk and Karen were extremely easy to communicate with and always willing to help when we needed anything. The price seemed a little high for the area, however, it was cheaper than getting three hotel rooms for our family.

We were able to find great places to eat just by walking around the neighborhood. The apartment was ideal. Looks as pictured. Was very clean and welcoming. We didn't meet Andreas in person but he emailed and called to ensure everything went well. He was available by email/text/phone for any questions/issues (not that we had any). I would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>32501708</td><td>5/19/2015</td><td>12803678</td><td>Anahi</td><td>Pasamos unos hermosos dias en el  departamento de andreas tiene una ubicacionn peefecta cerca de todo super limpio y comodo.

Great place for couples the patio was great to sit and drink wine at the end of day. Air conditioning kept the place at a perfect temperature.

And during our stay.  He was great at accommodating our check in and check out times and always was in great contact with us.  I really liked how he worked with the apt layout to give it a feel of spaciousness and light but at the same time very cozy as well.  Both the bed and pull down sofa futon were very comfortable too.  The terrace is a wonderful way to start your day with an alfresco breakfast. \n</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>34717445</td><td>6/11/2015</td><td>8501700</td><td>Nikhil</td><td>I was in new york for a 3 day family vacation and this place was perfect in every sense for me. The location is just walk away from times square, which makes it easy for elder poople to avoid travel hassle. The apartment is well maintained and clean with all the facilities which we can expect from a vacation home. Andreas is a great host as he also took great care of our luggage due to early check in.

It REALLY needs a professional cleaning top to bottom, side to side.  If this had been my first Airbnb rental, I would never rent through Airbnb again.  With just a thorough cleaning and a few inexpensive upgrades, this apartment would be fabulous.  The size is perfect for two or three people.  The air conditioners worked flawlessly.  Most of the necessities were provided with a fair amount of storage space and a large closet for clothing.  The location was the best, in a quiet neighborhood, quiet building, with the small porch off the back door, also quiet.  The wi-fi worked very well.  It’s just a short walk to subway, bus lines, and hundreds of restaurants.  A grocery store is a block away.  Also, there is a nice little park just across the street.  The check-in procedure is a little quirky but understandable.</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>35461571</td><td>6/19/2015</td><td>2062565</td><td>Kristy</td><td>Location Location location! for a short trip to NYC - this flat was incredible!

This place is in the heart of the city. My partner and I stayed here for a week and absolutely loved it. It's in a neighborhood with a lot of great restaurants and amazing bars all within walking distance. Times Square is a few short blocks away as is Broadway, Rockefeller Center, The Empire State building, shopping on 5th ave, Central Park, Bryant park and sooooo many other attractions. The subway is half a block away. The apartment looks just like the pictures shown. Clean and comfortable. The patio is very nice to have! It was a great place to sit outside, have coffee, and enjoy the quiet before rushing off into the noisy city streets. We met Andres and he showed us to the apt as soon as we got into the city. He even recommended some Broadway shows and restaurants to go to, which we did and all were amazing recommendations. All in all we would definitely stay here again. Great and easy find.</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>36970384</td><td>7/3/2015</td><td>34399583</td><td>Tracy</td><td>Greatly enjoyed our stay!  Location is AWESOME!

Más allá de la ubicación, los detalles y el estado del departamento son tal cual lo que se ve en las fotos publicadas en AirBnb. Andrés es un gran anfitrión y nos trató de maravillas, solucionándonos, incluso, nuestra vuelta al aeropuerto JFK. Hay un único detalle que, en principio, complica el uso del departamento, se trata de que pocos días antes de irnos a NY nos enteramos que para ingresar de día debíamos dejar nuestras valijas en un depósito y que posteriormente Andrés se encargaría de llevarlas; a decir verdad, cumplió perfectamente con su compromiso, pero si se tiene en cuenta que llegar a NY nos llevó casi 24 horas de viaje (Buenos Aires - Santiago - Santiago - NY), el hecho de no contar con nuestras valijas y cosas inmediatamente al llegar fue una carga. Más allá de eso, es entendible la necesidad de manejarse con cautela al entrar y salir teniendo en cuenta las fuertes multas de las que pueden ser pasibles los dueños de departamentos ofrecidos en alquiler temporario en la ciudad de NY. En resumen, salvo por el hecho del ingreso y egreso con valijas del departamento, en el resto de los aspectos fue todo maravilloso y Andrés fue muy generoso con nosotros, definitivamente recomiendo alquilar este departamento a todo aquel que quiera visitar NY y manejarse caminando o en subterráneo.</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>40088076</td><td>7/28/2015</td><td>32153907</td><td>Evelyn</td><td>This apartment was PERFECT!!!! First off, the location can't be beat. It's close to everything a visitor to NYC needs. It was my mother (75), myself (50) and my daughter (16). I mention ages because I didn't want my mother to have to endure a 3 to 4 floor walk up and my daughter left the apartment, camera in hand, to explore the surrounding neighborhood without me worrying. A block away is the Amish market (excellent grocery). Two to three blocks-several subway and bus lines going up and downtown and Times Square.  15-20 minute walks to the Circle line, Central Park, MOMA, Rockefeller Center. Also a bike share right across the street-I rode the bike down the Westside highway to the beginning of the Highline, walked thru it then biked home. Perfect!\n</td></tr><tr><td>2359340</td><td>43965747</td><td>8/23/2015</td><td>4187511</td><td>Vimal</td><td>The apartment is nice and we didn't hv any problems. The location of the building is pretty good but the apartment itself is at the back of the building at the end of a corridor and therefore there is hardly any natural light coming in.

It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>2595</td><td>217981296</td><td>12/10/2017</td><td>2548115</td><td>W.

I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didn’t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away.

The neighborhood was as described and I never felt unsafe walking around at anytime. Lisa also gave us a guidebook of restaurants and bars to try in the area that proved to be very helpful.

Neighborhood is pretty quiet and many places being updated in the area. I was a little apprehensive about the arrangement of sharing a house but the layout of the house is such it's not an issue. This is a great value with the kitchen. Lisa made sure we had directions from the airport, which were perfect. I'd recommend staying here. </td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>59155937</td><td>1/7/2016</td><td>29384335</td><td>Hayden</td><td>Had a wonderful time, very cosy and warm compared to the freezing temperatures outside.

Lisa è sempre stata disponibile a darci informazioni e verso le nostre esigenze. L alloggio è funzionale e pulito. Si accede attraverso una scala un Po stretta,(se si hanno problemi di mobilita potrebbe essere un problema) ma noi non abbiamo avuto problemi. Il  bagno è nuovo appena ristrutturato. La cucina è funzionante con l occorrente per preparare un semplice pasto. I letti sono comodi e le stanze abbastanza grandi dove mettere le valigie e i vestiti. Lenzuola e asciugamani puliti e in ottimo stato.Per correttezza di recensione senza nulla togliere l'alloggio, nelle foto sembra migliore con rifiniture più accurate, ma ripeto pulito e funzionale. L aria condizionata funziona a dovere e il WI FI  funzionale benissimo. Il quartiere sembra un Po trascurato, ma sembra sicuro,noi siamo rientrati anche a tarda sera senza mai avere sensazioni di pericolo o insicurezza. Nelle vicinanze sulla Franklin vi sono supermercati, negli isolati adiacenti vi sono piccoli negoziati aperti fino a tardi. La metropolitana si trova a 10 minuti. Nei dintorni vi sono diverse linee di bus. Ringraziamo Lisa per l ospitalità.

LisaRoxanne gave us privacy and we came & went as we pleased. The neighbourhood is great with lots of local food options - however it is on the flight path & the buses make it a bit noisy. We also hadn't realised that the trip in/out of Manhatten each day was fairly time consuming - in essence it gave us a great opportunity to see 'normal' life & we would never have gone to Brooklyn otherwise - which we really enjoyed - however as 'tourists' it was a trek in/out of the city\n</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>106175332</td><td>10/4/2016</td><td>77750040</td><td>Annje</td><td>Alles war supersauber und nett hergerichtet.

The apartment is relatively well located for the subway (less than 10 mins walk) and was equipped as shown in the pictures. Short walk to a few coffee shops/restaurants/bars. The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor. LisaRoxanne was a friendly and responsive host before and during our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>107304979</td><td>10/9/2016</td><td>21232644</td><td>Steve</td><td>Super great location for our needs\n</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>107843460</td><td>10/12/2016</td><td>2708447</td><td>Sandy</td><td>Lisa was Awesome and her place was Great.

The set up is odd as it is actually inside their home. It is not a private apt/space and therefore should not be advertised as such. There is one key to the building's main entrance downstairs and that is it. The space does not have a front door you can lock when you leave for the day. You can hear the host family clearly as they are right down a few step (interior staircase). </td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>131252030</td><td>2/11/2017</td><td>44430509</td><td>Charlie</td><td>Great place to stay on a budget! LisaRoxanne was friendly and accommodating. Plenty of beds and overnight materials for up to 5 guests, but know it's one bedroom and one kitchen/bathroom area on the top floor of their home, so it's not exactly the most private place to stay, but we were absolutely given our space and could easily come and go as we wished.</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>132441463</td><td>2/17/2017</td><td>29683319</td><td>Hannah</td><td>Our stay was absolutely perfect.

We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but when we were there it was just fine! The bed is comfortable and all the linens were clean. There are some thin curtains that work for privacy and do block some night street light, but not all. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet and we didn't see anyone except when we checked in. Private enough for us. We heard people occasionally - the family has some kids - but it was just normal living noises. The check-in was flexible. The location is good in terms of being accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten. It was easy to get anywhere by car (or transit). We were able to get to Prospect Park very easily and it is close to transit lines, although we didn't use transit as we had our dog. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and felt safe. Close to Clinton Hill. Great to be dog friendly for us! Would stay again. </td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>133456752</td><td>2/22/2017</td><td>20622469</td><td>Katie</td><td>LisaRoxanne's place was just what we needed after a long flight.

All this is located at the top of this family Brooklyn brownstone, which does mean using the same front door and staircase as the family but hey this is what airB'nB is all about isn't it?

It was lovely to come back to this quiet neighborhood after a day of bustle in the city. There are several sweet markets, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance as well. It was nice to have the whole third floor with a full kitchen so you can cook if you like. This was especially handy for breakfast and coffee.  You can hear their sweet kids playing downstairs. It's not intrusive--they really respected our privacy-and it's just normal happy family noise. It was a wonderful stay all around!

We would recommend anyone to stay there.  Great kitchen, bathroom is good and the bed extra comfy.  Being on the top floor we didn't hear a lot of passing traffic. Highly recommend this Airbnb.

Upon arrival Lisa was very quick to get to the door and was in constant contact with us. The only thing that really was a concern for us was the smell of cats. My husband and I are both sensitive to cats and it finally caught up with us the last evening/morning of staying. The room was perfect for what we needed because we spent most of our time in the city. Only thing I wished the room had was a full length mirror so I could see my outfits better for our evenings. I would definitely recommend staying at Lisa's for any type of trip. She was a great host and evening got us a bottle of wine for our anniversary.

If you're limited on luggage space you could walk in here with nothing but clothes - LisaRoxanne has thought of everything from toothbrushes to UK adaptors! The space is great and transport into Manhattan easy.  You can have privacy if you want it but they are such a nice family I can't think why you wouldn't want to interact. Her little boy Isiah (sorry if I got that wrong) is a real darling.  Can't recommend highly enough. </td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>168465269</td><td>7/9/2017</td><td>38961133</td><td>Roger</td><td>Low-key, quiet residential neighborhood with equally low-key but excellent nearby cafés and restaurants, and if you need stores, the DeKalb-Bedford Avenue business district is a 10-15-minute walk. Six to 10-minute walk to the nearest subway lines (G, S, A and C trains), and a 12-minute walk + subway ride or 25-minute walk to downtown Brooklyn. LisaRoxanne is friendly and attentive.

Die Küche ist mit Gasherd, Backofen, Toaster, Mikrowelle und einer Kühl-/Gefrierkombi gut ausgestattet. Die Betten waren bequem und der Geräuschpegel überraschend gering. Die Fenster isolieren nicht viele Geräusche, da die Wohnung aber in einem ruhigen und unserem Eindruck nach friedlichem Viertel liegt war das kein Problem. Das rund 7Mbit schnelle WLAN funktionierte Problemlos, LisaRoxanne war durchgehend gut zu erreichen und hat alle Fragen gerne beantwortet. Beim Check-In und Out sowie beim Verlassen und Betreten des Hauses zwischendurch gab es keine Probleme. Auch die Anbindung an die Subway ist gut, bis zur Clinton Washington Av, von der man ohne Umsteigen zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten in Manhattan kommt, ist nur knapp 15 Minuten entfernt. An der Station gibt es auch einen gut sortierten Supermarkt.

It is the third floor in a house, so there is no door shutting off the rented floor from the rest of the house, rather the top of the stairs ends in the landing. The bedroom door does have a lock on the knob. Gave 3 stars just because of the noise we experienced. We were awakened at 2am when the family came home, then again around 6:30am when the kids were playing in their play area and getting ready for school. Since there is no closed off area, the noise from the second floor, which is the kids’ room and living area, carries quite a bit. \n</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>359934768</td><td>12/18/2018</td><td>22889557</td><td>Kyle</td><td>As described</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>360187969</td><td>12/19/2018</td><td>159713213</td><td>Callan</td><td>Friendly host and convenient location.</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>364869110</td><td>12/31/2018</td><td>102967128</td><td>Róbert</td><td>LisaRoxanne is very nice and helpful, she helped a lot us.

The only downside was that they own a cat, which was not mentioned in the listing. I have an allergy to cats, so I probably would have not booked this place knowing I would get puffy eyes/itchy throat. It even jumped on me in the middle of the night, awaking me from my sleep. Overall, though, we were happy with our stay. You definitely can't beat the value.</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>481323005</td><td>7/4/2019</td><td>38440982</td><td>Maxine</td><td>We had a perfect stay at LisaRoxanne‘s place.

She took the time to show us everything in the apartment that we may need and even offered us to use her personal things if we needed them. Don’t let the 5 floor walk-up scare you, my wife and I travelled up and down these stairs many times per day. My wife handled the stairs like a champ and she is nearing 6 months pregnant. We were also able to walk to Times Square and to many of the activities that we did during the trip. As long as you don’t mind a bit of a walk, the location is great. We enjoyed all of the exploring that we got to do along the way. There were also some great places to eat within a block or two.

Especially, i barely slept due to the noises (construction, buses, fights of drunken men and women all night) ... i think that it might be because of the way air conditioner is attached to the window.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>8211</td><td>8/24/2009</td><td>32936</td><td>Tomas</td><td>Absolutely excellent.

Shun is a gracious and unobtrusive host.  He even offered to connect his extra laptop for me to have web access to look up theater times, museum info, etc.  The microwave, refrigerator, and flat panel TV (with cable) are all great amenities.  The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!  Thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  You guys were wonderful!!</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>16180</td><td>11/4/2009</td><td>23681</td><td>Eddie</td><td>What a wonderful experience.  WOW!

Shun met me as soon as I arrived on his doorstep. He showed me in and left me alone.  He seemed to understand from the moment I got there what I wanted and needed.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I can’t wait to go back again. Thank you, Shun!  </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>23551</td><td>1/7/2010</td><td>64742</td><td>Shahar</td><td>the room is very nice and warm. the hosts are realy nice and friendly. the location of the place is great, close to all the places we wanted to visit in n.y and to the subway. highly recomended </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>24797</td><td>1/24/2010</td><td>66519</td><td>Jeff</td><td>My hosts were the best.

We had our privacy and the room was exactly as show on the photo. Very basic but clean. We probably only saw Shun 2 or 3 times during our stay. It was our first visit to New York and it would have been appreciated if Shun had at least on one occasion (perhaps upon arrival or the day after) offered some information about the area or check with us if we had any questions. We thought Shun was friendly but very reserved .Bottom line: great location, close to places of interest (we practically walked everywhere), clean but basic accommodation, however, don't expect a social, interactive host because once you've checked-in, you're on your own! Not an unpleasant experience overall.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>154880</td><td>12/17/2010</td><td>172204</td><td>Bernard</td><td>Great stay at Shun's apartment.

Perfect location for NYC, easy to get around on foot and subway (5min walk to closest subway).  24hr conveient store downstairs, bottle shop, pharmacy not far.  Shun was very quiet and kept to himself.  For what you pay, I couldn't ask for anything else.  Our plane was delayed because of the blizzard and didn't arrive till late at night.  He let us in and made us a coffee!  </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>167058</td><td>1/6/2011</td><td>321907</td><td>Shin Gern</td><td>I personally think that this apartment is a total worth of it's money. Yes, you could get an apartment which is halve it's price, but Shun keeps his place perfectly clean and provides many unexpected ammenities! Being a 3 street walk away from the Colombus Circle Subway, it's surrounding area's are brightly lit even after midnight.  </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>169667</td><td>1/12/2011</td><td>125217</td><td>Danyah</td><td>Shun's place is ideal for a short break to New York - just a 10 minute walk or less to times square and maybe 5 minutes to central park. Safe neighbourhood to walk around in at night.

It's about 15 mins by train to 34th street or Times square station.  There is couple of restaurants around the corner and pharmacy for all your immediate needs.  Shun was very flexible accomodating me as I was later than expected due to travel complications.  He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.  I would say location-wise and room needs this was a decent place.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>188631</td><td>2/26/2011</td><td>285023</td><td>Manon</td><td>It was a perfect location.

Shun was very accommodating from initial contact to meeting up, making the whole experience hassle free. Perfect location to get around to all the sights and around restaurants/eateries not in the high tourist area. Had a great meal/marguerita at Cancun, just around the corner. The room is as described, handy to have your own fridge/kettle in the room, and great to spread out on the table/chair/shelves/wardrobe so you're not living out of your bag the whole time. Would recommend to others looking for budget accommodation without sacrificing too much.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>198656</td><td>3/14/2011</td><td>274106</td><td>Jai</td><td>The location is amazing and Shun is a very wonderful host.

Overall reasonable for the price, thanks Shun.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>644485</td><td>10/19/2011</td><td>521606</td><td>Lyn</td><td>Shun is so kind, the room is big (he kindly put an extra mattress for a third person) and is really comfortable. The bathroom was always clean and available and he offers everything you can need. The location is the best, you are close to everything, just two blocks of the nearest subway and in the area are plenty of delis so you can eat cheap and on the go. Only one thing, try to visit NY without many lugage, because travelling on the subway, streets or taking luggage trough the stairs, is not so nice if you have big pieces. \n</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>686637</td><td>11/2/2011</td><td>1200517</td><td>Renee</td><td>I can't really complain.  It was great considering the price and area.  The area was very convenient and perfect for me.    Shun was rarely ever home, but very nice.  He let me store my luggage for about 4 hours after check out because I didn't want to lug it around.  I would stay here again for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>697252</td><td>11/7/2011</td><td>744809</td><td>Jana</td><td>Having booked the first time with airbnb we were happy that our host and room was as described earlier. Shun is a friendly guy who still was preparing our room when we arrived an hour  early as announced. The room was large enough for two, has fridge and sat TV. Shun provided WIfi and wired internet access. The clean room itself is located near a subway which makes going with metro very easy. We have been a lot around in manhattan and enjoyed our stay for sleep and a shower at Shun. Near to this room we suggest a visit at Carnegie Deli for breakfast. Thanx Shun for beeing our host.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>740991</td><td>11/24/2011</td><td>721906</td><td>Bernedett</td><td>We we're about 2 hours late because of traffic and when we arrive Shun was very helpfull, he help with carring up our bags, he helped up with the closest subway.

Shun was very accommodating with arrival times and showed us around the apartment when we arrived. Room is quite large, well heated, and has great amenities (fridge, microwave, kettle). Most of the time we did not even see the hosts, as they kept to themselves or were at work. Only problem we had was getting the shower to stay at a decent temperature as it tended to be too hot or cold. Otherwise was a great experience, would definitely recommend!  </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>798934</td><td>12/21/2011</td><td>882170</td><td>Eric</td><td>Great location, walking distance to Columbus Circle, Central Park and Times Square.

It is very simple, but has everything one need to a good staying. Shunichi is concerned in providing a good accomodation and was available when requested. </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>852090</td><td>1/9/2012</td><td>1456486</td><td>Vivian</td><td>My sister and I stayed in Shun's apt for 4 nights.

Also located very close to a metro stop so getting around is very simple.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>872866</td><td>1/20/2012</td><td>1430948</td><td>Dale</td><td>Because I was in NYC in January specifically to see a number of shows (8!) and visit MOMA, the Guggenheim and the new World Trade Center memorial, staying at Shunichi's was perfect for me.  The room was warm and comfortable.  The small refrigerator and microwave were extremely helpful in keeping expenses down.  (Shun offers access to his kitchen off the main living room but I never used it, except to wash a few dishes.)  There is a TV, and the bed is large and cozy.  The bathroom is nice, and the shower is very good.  One irony is that, after an initial meeting with Shun during which he gave me a friendly orientation to the room and the apartment, I only caught brief glimpses of him for the next 9 days.  He was off to work by 8:00 a.m. and came home usually late so I had almost no contact with him!  For someone like me, seeking a warm abode while spending most days and many evenings out and about in Manhattan and Brooklyn, it was an extremely economical way to visit NYC and stay in a very central location (Website hidden by Airbnb)</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>878719</td><td>1/23/2012</td><td>1582319</td><td>Micah</td><td>Clean room.

The room is large for NY standards, the location is amazing, there's a fridge, microwave, dishes, tea, and water kettle.  And towels.  The room isn't perfectly clean like a hotel, but it's like staying in a friend's house.

Shun came down to the door and let me in. Perhaps he did this in order to lead me directly to the apartment the first time, as I might conceivably have gotten confused as to where the apartment is, due to the stairway and apartment layout. Anyway, first appearances of the building might be scary for some. It is rather run down. Indeed, the apartment must not have enough storage space because there are boxes lining the hallway leading to the main part of the apartment. The room is very basic, but is as advertised. There is a small refrigerator, some dishes and a microwave, a TV and WiFi. The apartment could use a cosmetic facelift, for sure, but apart from that, it was comfortable enough, though spartan. After introductions, I didn't see Shun again until shortly before I left. All in all, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for everyone, I would definitely return due to the convenience of location. Shun is pleasant, very quiet and reliable.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>1301779</td><td>5/19/2012</td><td>1523333</td><td>Fabio</td><td>Great host. I and my wife love each moment.

If you are a good walker, you can do a lot of things even without taking a taxi or the subway. Otherwise, a lot of subway stations are nearby. The apartment is none too cozy, but it is big and very private and you have everything in it you need (Wifi, dishes, fridge etc) and by the way, you will hardly find an accommodation in this area which offers you all this and still is affordable.  We really had a great time in New York!</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>1398144</td><td>6/2/2012</td><td>1293015</td><td>Kaylene</td><td>Great value for money, Shun's place is so central and you just can't match it for the price.

The lodging is exactly as described, furnished with a terrific A/C, mini-refrigerator and microwave. Queen bed is comfy. Situation is perfect for a theater-goer, by walking or easy cab ride. I'm slightly mobility-disabled and Shun's unit is just one flight up. He helped me with luggage on arrival. Perfect wireless. Several reasonable eating options very close:  Bread Box on 8th and Hale/Hearty (soup,salad,sandwich) across street. Thank you, Shun!</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>5688823</td><td>7/12/2013</td><td>4803765</td><td>Ken</td><td>Location, location, location!  Shunichi's place has the perfect location in New York - you walk out the door to restaurants, laundreys, whatever you want - and can then walk to Central Park or the Broadway theater district with ease.  At first I thought his building was a little run-down, but the room itself had everything I needed - a small fridge, air-conditioning (it was hot!), a microwave, dishes, cutlery, a desk, storage space, and a comfortable bed.  The shower would be better with more water pressure, but this was a minor matter.  Shun himself was there waiting for me and helped with the luggage.  He's a fairly quiet, retiring sort and I didn't see him much during my stay - which made me feel like it was my own place.  A great stay - thanks, Shun!</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>6608967</td><td>8/19/2013</td><td>1785051</td><td>Laurence</td><td>Shunichi is a great host, very discreet, yet helpful.\n</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>7065945</td><td>9/5/2013</td><td>6453658</td><td>Stéphanie</td><td>Très bon séjour à New York dans cette chambre très bien située au centre de Manhattan (moins de 5 min de marche de Central park, 5th Avenue, la station de métro et de nombreux magasins et restaurants).\n</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>7270810</td><td>9/14/2013</td><td>4965674</td><td>Alessio</td><td>The location is great!

The room and bathroom were clean, and the location was good. I would definitely stay at his place again. </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>8470698</td><td>11/1/2013</td><td>9486553</td><td>Subhash</td><td>For starters, great location. I was in NYC for only 3 days and 2 nights which meant i had to do a lot of running around and the location certainly helped. The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!!</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>8620543</td><td>11/9/2013</td><td>4508112</td><td>Paul</td><td>Great location, perfect sized room, friendly host & environment in general. The location near corner of 55th St & 8th ave is perfect. Short walk to subway, central park, times sq, plenty of places to eat, etc etc etc. Just perfect really. Anyone who hasn't been to Manhattan the place is easy to get around to all tourist attractions via the subway. $31 for a 7-day MetroCard with unlimited train & bus use.  Shunichi met me at check in & showed my the unit & all important things. We didn't see each other much at all for my whole 8-day stay. I will book with Shunichi again / every visit to NYC. Thanks again Shunichi.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>8848156</td><td>11/21/2013</td><td>197711</td><td>J. B.</td><td>This is my second time staying with Shunichi, and he  is a gracious host.

The room is small and can be cramped.  It is a good incentive to be out sightseeing all day and only using it for sleeping in. The bed was uncomfortable though.  But you cannot beat the location! The room is located four doors from the Soup Man and a 10 min walk to Times Square and 5 min walk to Central Park. Meals are best had outside the room at any of the many nearby diners and restaurants. Great breakfast at Cosmic Diner.  The shared bathroom was not a problem and the water was hot. Consider this if you want location and are prepared to put up with basics.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>9124985</td><td>12/9/2013</td><td>683217</td><td>Kelly</td><td>If u are fine with older spaces with character, this space will be fine for you.  I loved that I had a completely separate room with my own keys and the bathroom was in the hall between my rom and his living room ets areas so I felt very comfortable. I was not there more than 6 hours each day and never saw him after he let me in.  It was worth the cost savings.  Just be aware this IS NOT A HOTEL   Bring a towel.  I had to buy one.  It was very close to everything.  Just a couple short blocks and 2 blocks from subway.  I would stay again. </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>9237262</td><td>12/16/2013</td><td>8168261</td><td>Tara</td><td>Super convenient location for exploring Midtown, the room had everything I needed and Shun was lovely on the brief occasion I met him.

Shun was very welcoming, honest and reliable, the room was warm (this was winter time) and the bed was comfy. The place could do with a lick of paint and some artwork, but for the price we'd highly recommend Shun's apartment.

The apartment is clean, the bathroom as well. Our room, too. The TV-set is useless, there are no tv channels. The only thing: the plastic knives and forks have been very dirty (have already been used?) and it has been very cold in the room. But if you go there in late spring/summer, you might not have any problems at all. However this is the perfect place to stay for a small budget and is very close to Central Park and Times Square.

As the host had told us, he or she (we never got to know their gender) would not be at the apt when we arrived. Instead, we were given the keys and some info on the location of the room and the shared bathroom, by a friend of the host. Although the apt was not as shown in the pictures, but a little dirtier and with the walls really bad painted, we did not care. The building is very old and the rugs look disgusting, but we did not care either.... until we spent the first 2 nights and we realised we were not alone. The room was heavily infested with bed bugs.  Out of the 4 nights payed, we could not sleep for 2 whole nights, I had to get medications for rashes that developed from the bites and I had our clothes and baggage sterilized because these bugs travel with you once you get them.\n</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>12742051</td><td>5/10/2014</td><td>12330938</td><td>Kalee</td><td>I highly recommend staying with Shun.

As a former New York resident, the room looked like the average apartment, although I have to admit that the pictures made the room looked cleaner and new.  I love that they were towels on the shelves, hair spray, and a microwave included.  Our stay was brief (8:30pm to 4am) as we were on a flight layover. We left our luggages and mostly roamed the city the majority of the night.  There's a small couch. The location was perfect as it is in midtown steps away from Columbus Circle.  Safe neighborhood.

Forse per la camera puo' bastare , praticamente le foto che vedete dell'host risalgono a quando praticamente si e' costruito questo appartamento .Il bagno non ne parliamo il bordo vasco e' di uno spessore di 3 cm nero, e c'era una spugna che era in uno stato di putrefazione! Praticamente potevo beccare qualche malattia.Comunque non voglio allungarmi scrivendo quello che ho trascorso in 5 notti in quella orrenda casa , vi dico solo di stare lontano da questa casa e non accettate nemmeno se il prezzo e' bassissimo perche' la vostra vacanza sara' rovinata!!!

So I feel asleep within an hour after arriving at his apartment and didn't wake up until the next morning.  Which goes to show that the room faces a quiet street and that the bed is comfortable, even if a metal frame.  The room is as it looks in the photo, with the additions of a table cloth, cups, mugs and a small mirror, without the plant, stool and dark full length curtain, now replaced by a shorter one that lets the light through it.  Shunichi was very communicative about my move in and had no problem with me coming earlier than I initially indicated,nor with me leaving my luggage at his place until I left the city the following day.

The whole place smelled musty. The shelves were grimy, we had to wipe them down ourselves. There was also lots of hair strands on the duvet, but thankfully no bugs.

Es befindet sich in einem stark renovierungsbedürftigen Zustand. Flecken an der Decke, dreckige Wände und auch auch der Bereich, wo der Kühlschrank und die Mikrowelle stehen, ist sehr keimig.

The picture is a good reference of what to expect, although simply add an unpleasant layer of grime to everything and you have a more accurate idea. My main issue was that the room, while tidy, felt unclean and the bathroom was unpleasantly dirty, to say the least. The apartment looks really worn and it is right next to the trash room, so opening the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting. However, the inside of the apartment smelled fine. I appreciated that the room is independent of the owner's space, as a door separates the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner's room. It was also very convenient that the room came with a fridge, microwave, toaster, and even plates and cutlery. It is pleasantly large and the bed was more of a full-sized futon. The a/c worked, but not very well, which is not an inconvenience unless one comes in the summertime like I did. Our host provided us with a room key, so it was nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturbed. I didn't really see much of the owner, as a friend of his welcomed me when I arrived, and I believe that if I hadn't proceeded to ask him a few questions the one day I saw him at the apartment, we might never have talked, as he always left before I did and arrived apparently after. However, the main thing about this apartment is the location. Incredible location! It is walking distance from  Columbus Circle and all the theater area and Times Square, which made it very convenient when I got out of a play late at night. There are also a number of grocery stores nearby, including an organic whole foods style one. There are nearby subway stations and tons of restaurants, so it is easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>86350734</td><td>7/16/2016</td><td>78804951</td><td>John</td><td>Perfect location for the show I was seeing- thanks to the host for offering this.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>86591242</td><td>7/17/2016</td><td>48344389</td><td>Arianna</td><td>\"The person (host's friend) that was supposed to let us in the apartment at the schedule time wasn't there, so we had to wait almost an hour, until the previous guest open the door for us.

I just let him know about what time I was expected to arrive and he arranged a friend to let me in and provide me the keys. You can't beat the location. It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here. In fact, if I ever do return to NYC, this is the first place I'll check to find a place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>91114922</td><td>8/3/2016</td><td>56124242</td><td>Eric</td><td>Localização! o local é espetacular e de fácil acesso ao metrô e mesmo à pé para os principais pontos turísticos de Manhattan.

I was able to leave my luggage until mid-afternoon on the day of check-out, which eased my travel around the the city.

J'ai beaucoup hésité pour la note entre 3 et 4 mais finalement j'ai tranché sur un 3 et je m'explique tout de suite. Tout d'abord parlons des points positifs : - l'appartement a une situation idéale, à 5 min de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Time Square. Le top ! On était à proximité de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle où on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment étalé, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on était vraiment à l’aise) et des équipements à dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nécessaires de toilette, des plans de NY à dispo... - la cuisine est à dispo et à tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods à gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse également. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se préparer, pour utiliser le lavabo… Mais malheureusement il y a quand même quelques points négatifs à retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propreté en général. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussière dans l'appartement. Mais là c'était vraiment très limite, sans parler de la vétusté de l'appart, la salle de bain était vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussière par terre, le lavabo n'était pas nettoyé, je doute que le tapis soit lavé par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz était grasse, noire de saleté... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprécié des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol n’était pas vraiment propre, et le frigo n’était pas nettoyé. Bref nous étions vraiment déçues par rapport à cela. Et je reprécise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en règle générale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'être très vieille (des barres de douche rouillées, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche était vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brûlante et une fois glacée, on arrivait à régler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marché toute la journée et qu'on est crevé. Enfin dernier point, plutôt mitigé - la communication avec l’hôte. Alors certes l’hôte est très discret et pour des gens comme moi qui préfère cela aux personnes envahissantes, c’était parfait. Néanmoins mon amie a regretté le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes même pas souhaités la bonne année, c’est quand même dommage quand deux...</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>126408979</td><td>1/11/2017</td><td>108364416</td><td>Justine</td><td>I stayed for one night to see a concert a Terminal 5 (just a 10 minute walk down the street) so the location was perfect.

If you want spotless living quarters, get a fancy hotel. Shunichi provided a comfortable room with a tv, DVD player(remote needs batteries), Small fridge, microwave oven, and other appliances such as a toaster, etc. There is also a closet and a shelf-system that is perfect for your clothes. Shunichi was very prompt in replying to texts when I got to town and near his residence. He helped me carry my luggage up the 1 flight of stairs and when I made an inquiry about salt, he was at my door within 2 minutes. And that was all I saw of my host the entire week. It was like I was all alone the entire week. Since I am not a Social Butterfly around strangers, it was perfect for me. Price was VERY reasonable for staying in NYC.

No tuvimos ningún problema, pero tampoco hubo nada especial que podamos comentar, lo único que destacó fue la ubicación, a pocas cuadras de central park y de times square.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>259258828</td><td>4/30/2018</td><td>20372891</td><td>Geneva</td><td>What a fabulous apartment! Perfect for the theatre-lover, as you are minutes walk from the best Broadway theatres. Shunichi gives you lots of privacy and the apartment is tidy and full of great touches. The listing is very straightforward, but I would argue that it’s better than the description! I recommend earplugs because there is street noise but you will get that anywhere in NYC! I will stay here again when I visit NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>266166390</td><td>5/19/2018</td><td>110055350</td><td>Maico</td><td>Excelente relación precio/ubicación. Estas a dos cuadras de Columbus Circle con todos los transportes a mano y cerca de todo y con Hell’s Kitchen a mano para comer todas las noches. Nos manejamos siempre a pie sin problemas. No pretendan limpieza o lujos pero si privacidad ya que el anfitrión prácticamente nunca estuvo presente. Ningún problema en particular y flexible con los horarios de checkin y checkout así que lugar recomendado (excepto para obsesivos con la limpieza a los cuales les sugiero pagar el doble un hotel)</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>270037571</td><td>5/28/2018</td><td>53685014</td><td>Gonzalo</td><td>La ubicación es inmejorable, se encuentra cerca del Central Park y Time Square.

Street noise broke sleep first night, despite fan -- then I adjusted but, as noted, it's present.  Bed was fine and large room with closet and desk makes for a good situation.  Bathroom is the only other room you have access to, but kettle and small fridge in bedroom makes it workable.  As noted, this is basic -- think dorm-room style -- then remind yourself again about the location; neighborhood felt safe even at night.  2nd floor with lots of stairs but also high ceiling in room of this old building. Host was prompt on communication and exceptionally quiet. </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>273006060</td><td>6/4/2018</td><td>108018206</td><td>Kirsten</td><td>Shunichi was an accomodating, respectful and friendly host. The apartment is nice, in walking distance of Central Park, and public transport in all parts of town easily accessible. There's at least four Starbucks, a Whole Foods and several 24-h pharmacies/stores in close vicinity. If you want to see New York, this is an awesome homebase. Would definitely recommend and stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>276035158</td><td>6/12/2018</td><td>155109016</td><td>Natalia</td><td>As the description says, don't expect luxuries. The room is okay and the bathroom is not the best but it works if you don't expect much and are there just to sleep at night and take a shower. The host was barely visible so you don't have to worry about him being in the way. We didn't get to use the kitchen but we never asked either so we don't know if it wasn't allowed at all. Overall, the location is great. There are a couple of subways, restaurants and markets to buy breakfast nearby. Not far from Times Square and Broadway. Shunichi was great at answering all questions we had so I really recommend to stay at his place while in New York.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>279084296</td><td>6/19/2018</td><td>19828093</td><td>Jorge</td><td>Lo mejor la ubicación, excelente. La casa no es acogedora ni limpia, pero la habitación es amplia, esta ordenada y tiene un sofa sucio q cubrimos con una manta del avion para usarlo. Además de la ubicación, tienes absoluta privacidad, a veces no sabes si Shunichi está en casa, entras y sales sin problema. La cama esta muy bien y las sabanas estaban limpias. La ducha no estaba limpísima pero las he visto mucho peores, es aceptable ducharse ahí si piensas en lo barato del alojamiento y el sitio en el q está. Si vas a New York para estar todo el dia en la calle, y pasar el tiempo justo en el alojamiento para dormir descansar y ducharte es una opcion barata que te gustará. Yo repetiría! No es apto para príncipes y princesas pero estás en pleno Manhattan por muy poco dinero. Shunichi es agradable y muy escueto, tuvimos un problema con una llave y lo solucionó rapidamente. Todo fue correcto.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>280153286</td><td>6/22/2018</td><td>182125003</td><td>Jimmy</td><td>Shunichi offers a place to stay in Manhattan without the huge cost. He was very accommodating for early checking and checkouts. Granted, it could use an interior makover, but it was comfortable, quiet and close to shops, restaurants, and the Subway.  I see it already booked for the rest of the year, so I recommend you book early for next summer.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>285359545</td><td>7/3/2018</td><td>157273986</td><td>Oscar</td><td>Wonderful location right in hells kitchen.

Though it was very hot and hard to sleep, Shunichi provided us with another air con and it worked well. The bathroom had some stains, grime and mold. There were old curtains but it got the job done. The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal. But the cleanliness can be worked on. </td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>310472808</td><td>8/19/2018</td><td>160482290</td><td>Waka</td><td>This is my first Airbnb stay and I am very satisfied.

El baño estaba sucio, sobre todo la ducha (moho en techo y cortinas de baño). El pasillo estaba lleno de trastos y olía un poco a humedad (es un bloque de edificios antiguo). Por otro lado, Shunichi fue muy educado aunque distante, como si no estuviese en casa. Nos dio facilidades para dejar la maleta en el pasillo el último día hasta que cogimos el avión. Lo más importante del apartamento es que está muy bien situado (entre Central Park y Times Square). Si no eres muy escrupuloso por lo del baño (y te llevas unas chanclas), en general está bien para lo que pagas. Si eres muy fino, busca otro.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>323002578</td><td>9/14/2018</td><td>95413871</td><td>Antonio</td><td>Just saw sunichi once when he leave the Keys so we really didnt get the chance to Know him\n</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>325372765</td><td>9/19/2018</td><td>72603324</td><td>Jonathan</td><td>Great location and value in Manhattan!

The bathroom was not sparkling clean, but you can't expect that in an older apartment.  Overall, I was satisfied, and I felt like I got a good deal since I paid a lot less than I would at a hotel.

They were helpful and friendly but easy-going. The apartment is neat and clean and I felt very save in the neighborhood. Any location in Manhatten can be reached easily. There were a fan and air-condition in the room and the bed was indeed very comfortable. I would definitely come back!</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>1691751</td><td>7/12/2012</td><td>2384884</td><td>Shaina</td><td>Mary Ellen is a godsend.  I got food poisoning during my stay, and she took wonderful care of me.  I can't get over what a kind hostess she is.  Believe it or not, I couldn't have been any more comfortable in my own house.  Thank you Mary Ellen!  I hope next time my stay is far less eventful for you!</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>2557612</td><td>10/9/2012</td><td>3202418</td><td>Natasha</td><td>I had the most wonderful time staying with the Lehman family. The room was cosy, the kids were great, and the apartment was easy to get to. I loved where I was staying in NYC and it was made possible by Mary Ellen. I was traveling on my ow be the girls Rachel and Sarah Grace were happy to converse with me whenever I was in the house. \n</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>2637919</td><td>10/16/2012</td><td>3721864</td><td>Jie</td><td>This was my first airbnb experience. Had a 2 nights stay and it was great! Everything's as per advertised. It was an easy, comfortable experience. I was travelling alone, so safety was the most important consideration I had. I had no problems returning to the apartment alone at night around 10+pm via subway. The subway exit was next to a 24 hours grocery store, so even at night, there are people walking around and the path was brightly lighted. The building entrance has a nice, helpful doorman in the evenings and was brightly lighted, with working elevator. The room was private and cosy. Empty apartments just feel haunted to me.. so I really liked that the apartment has a lived-in family ambience (but not noisy, I could do work on my laptop in the room without any disturbance). Rachel (one of the daughters), MaryEllen and Mike were really nice, friendly and helpful, the rest of the children were cheerful and friendly too. Rachel and Mike were very good with directions, even providing detailed instructions with hand-drawn maps! Room and bathroom were clean and neat. If you choose to stay at MaryEllen's place, I'll suggest to take supershuttle service for airport transfers - from JFK was about USD 25 and to LGA was about USD 20.</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>2822653</td><td>11/7/2012</td><td>3109628</td><td>Anna</td><td>I had a great stay and Mary Ellen and her family were lovely - especially after I had to make some changes due to storm Sandy, everything worked out well in the end :)</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>2891736</td><td>11/15/2012</td><td>79276</td><td>Yumiko</td><td>I have just stayed her place while 5 days. I actually had been living in this aria while long before moved to back to Japan. That is why This aria was perfect for me. It is very safe and convenience like just 20 minutes to get to Times Square. There are many good places to eat. Also, there some nice night places like Jazz live house or fancy bars. The room was very comfy. And it was completely private room. I enjoyed stayed her place and the neighborhood. Due to Sandy hurricane happened in NYC, I actually had to changed so many times my schedule. She was very flexible and helpful for it. Thank you Marry Ellen! I am defiantly coming back to in future! I am strongly suggest her place for your vacation!!</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>3031183</td><td>12/5/2012</td><td>3971266</td><td>Catherine</td><td>What a wonderful experience!  This family is terrific.  Being from a large family myself, having the parents and children around was a real treat.  In addition of having my own room, the kitchen was available for me to use and the bathroom was pretty much mine, too.  The true surprise was listening to the children play piano each evening - they are really good!  Next time I'm in New York, I will definitely hook up with Mary Ellen and her family.</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>3104542</td><td>12/17/2012</td><td>4166070</td><td>Jessica</td><td>NY was a little overwhelming at first and MaryEllen's apartment was exactly the place I needed to recoup. The room is cozy, the shower is hot and the neighborhood is safe. I was even able to score some delicious homemade raviolis on their pasta night! Couldn't have asked for a better host family. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>3121169</td><td>12/19/2012</td><td>593077</td><td>Tracy</td><td>MaryEllen was a fantastic host!  She was so flexible with me, and even accepted  a date that she did not list as available because it worked for my schedule.  So helpful!  Also the apartment is in a great neighborhood, 2 blocks from the subway.  Very safe area and doorman in the evenings.   The room was exactly as described, the bed and linens were very comfortable.  While I didn't have too much interaction with all of the family, the interaction I did have, they were kind and helpful and so polite!  I would absolutely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>3608641</td><td>2/22/2013</td><td>2384884</td><td>Shaina</td><td>I love staying here.  It's convenient, comfy, and I feel right at home.  The bed and sheets are perfect, the terry cloth robe is very cozy, and breakfast is delicious.  Mary Ellen and her family are wonderful!  Thanks for everything.</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>3885802</td><td>3/25/2013</td><td>4519848</td><td>Melissa</td><td>After deciding that I was going to relocate from New Zealand to New York, I was hit with the task of finding safe, clean, and affordable accommodation in an incredibly overpriced city.  Finding MaryEllen's apartment was the best thing I could have done - the location was great, less than a 1 minute walk to a major subway line, safe, well-lit, very clean area.  MaryEllen's building also has an elevator which is such a lifesaver after all those steps you take getting around the city!  MaryEllen and her family are also so generous with their time in assisting you with advice on how to get to the places you need to be.  This was my first AirBnB experience, and it couldn't have been better!</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>4045281</td><td>4/5/2013</td><td>1966311</td><td>Georgeta</td><td>I enjoyed my stay. The room was as depicted in the picture. The bathroom was just across the room, no clutter, clean. Providing a fluffy white robe was  very thoughtful and added to the cozy feel. MarryEllen and her family were delightful, I only feel sorry I was so busy that I did not have more time to chitchat a lit bit more. Additionally, the location of the apartment is great, just off Broadway, close to subway and restaurants. Very safe. Perfect for anyone visiting NYC. Thanks MaryEllen. </td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>4146349</td><td>4/14/2013</td><td>3997059</td><td>Brenda</td><td>A perfect place for this solo traveler...great west side location, a comfy room, gracious accommodating hosts...and the background bustle of their lively family.  </td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>4431128</td><td>5/5/2013</td><td>4211636</td><td>Karen</td><td>This is perfect for someone who wants a homey, comfortable and personable place to stay. I was warmly welcomed by Mary Ellen when I arrived, and had opportunities for nice conversations with other family members during the course of my stay. I had plenty of privacy and could come and go on my own schedule - no pressure to socialize. The room was comfortable; the location is incredible: just two blocks from Central Park and between Amsterdam and Broadway, so it's close to plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and markets, as well as very close to public transportation lines. And where else could I hear piano music as I got ready for my day!</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>4563417</td><td>5/13/2013</td><td>5088903</td><td>Lisa</td><td>I really enjoyed my stay at Mary-Ellen's.  In fact, I felt extremely 'at home' there.  She and her family were so welcoming and I had several fun chats with their eldest daughter who was also very helpful.  My early arrival was accommodated, I was free to come and go as I pleased and the home-made granola with fruit and yoghurt at breakfast was delish.  Mary-Ellen even gave me some to go home with, along with the recipe, which I just made for the first time back in Paris.  Thanks Mary-Ellen & co!  :-)  A bientôt...</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>4699722</td><td>5/21/2013</td><td>1130261</td><td>Aline</td><td>This was my first time using airbnb and everything went good since booking the room and effectively staying.\n</td></tr><tr><td>5203</td><td>5226705</td><td>6/19/2013</td><td>492482</td><td>Maria De Lourdes</td><td>Very nice!

Beautiful the Cathedral of St. John the Divine 5 blocks away...Also my favorite place is Colombia university is also close. The campus is beautiful.

amazing host. She went above and beyond with maps, suggestions on food, and overall insight to our vacation. The apartment was as adorable as it is in the pictures, and we had an absolute wonderful time. The area of Brooklyn we stayed in was beautiful and great. If we go back again, we would 100% stay at this place! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We loved this apartment! In town for a wedding in Williamsburg, we wanted to stay a bit off the beaten path and this apartment was terrific. We were able to easily access nearby restaurants and cafes and enjoyed walking everywhere during our free time. Great weather afforded us the opportunity to have breakfast on the deck which boasts amazing morning sun. Lila provided a really helpful ‘welcome’ book for our stay (which we referenced multiple times!) and there were clear labels on all lights and appliances for ease of use. While our schedules prevented us from saying “Hello!” in person, Lila was only a message away if we needed anything which made us feel even more at ease. The apartment was clean, quiet, and a perfect fit for our weekend away from home. We would definitely stay again! Thanks, Lila! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Myself and a friend stayed at Lila's place in Brooklyn for 4 nights in November and I can honestly say it was amazing! Such a beautiful and well kept apartment with a 5 minute walk to the nearest subway. Would definitely recommend to anyone planning to visit NYC! \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What an amazing apartment in such an incredible location. Lila's brownstone is in the heart of Brooklyn, close to everywhere I wanted to be. She gave great recommendations on where to go (speedy romeo's was no joke!) and she was so hospitable. If you want to stay in Brooklyn and have an authentic experience with a real new yorker, stay at Lila's. \t</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The solitude, quiet neighborhood, minimal street traffic, proximity to fine dining areas, parks, and public transportation make this an excellent choice for lodging in Brooklyn. The apartment was easily accessed with flexible accommodation by our gracious host. We hope to return in the near future.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The apartment in Brooklyn was excellent, as photographed and described. The location was convenient for catching the C train across to Manhattan or into Brooklyn. The space was incredibly clean and well presented, the bed comfortable and the kitchen well equipped enough to cook for 5 nights.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was lovely, spacious and well stocked. The location was convenient for getting quickly around Brooklyn and Manhattan. The host was also very accommodating with plenty of good recommendations. I have nothing but positive things to say. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lila is an amazing host with a great space, vibe, and location. Highly recommend. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We loved Lilas flat and all her recommendations in the surroundings. The flat was clean and beautiful. Living in Brooklyn was perfect for us, interesting for us to visit this part of New York in addition to Manhattan. Lots of cool cafes for breakfast and morning coffee, as well as for lunch, and good restaurants for dinner..Easy going to Manhattan by subway.  Ca 5 min walk to nearest subway station, ca 30-40 min with subway to Manhattan. We also liked the subway tour every day, looking at people..</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lila's apartment was just incredible. Very accurate pictures and specs, but even more lovely in person! The deck is such a great benefit. Everything was very clearly labeled and Lila provided good directions. We felt very welcome and enjoyed the personal touches. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lila is just the best! She is friendly, personable and a perfectly accommodating host!  The space is amazing! Large, beautiful, with an amazing outdoor space in the back that is peaceful and shady...like being in your own private park! The neighborhood is friendly, diverse and very safe.  There is a bit of occasional street noise in the front of the house, but as long as you are a heavy sleeper this is not an issue.  Also, the bed is extremely comfortable!  Overall, highly recommend!  :)    </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We felt very safe and in good surroundings.  Lila was very accommodating and helpful about the are.  We would definitely consider going again. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lila's apartment was exactly as described in the listing and in a great location which made our stay really enjoyable. Communication was easy which made our overall experience excellent!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A very great experience.Lila is very good host and communicative.And the apartment is so beautiful and comfortable!We will come back again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great space in quiet neighborhood. Lila was an amazing host!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had such a wonderful time at Lila's place. The flat is located in a really calm street so it's good if you want to have a good night sleep but at the same time really close to tube station and great coffee places. The outdoor terrace is a real bonus, and Lila's tips about the neighborhood are great. We recommend and would definitively come back! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My partner and I have just returned from a 2 week stay in Lila's fantastic apartment. Clinton Hill is a fab spot in Brooklyn... a gorgeous, leafy, peaceful residential area with great restaurants and bars [and great coffee!] right on your doorstep. Our favourite was Locanda Vini & Olii which is right on the corner of the street - amazing food & wine and brilliant staff. Beautiful parks and gardens are close by too - just a short stroll away. Everything you could ask for! The apartment itself far exceeded our expectations... it is even more beautiful in reality than it looks online [which is saying something]. Lila has incredible taste and truly you couldn't want for anything more in terms of comfort. Brilliant bed and linen and stylish furnishings. And, if the season is on your side, the outdoor deck is a bonus too! The subway is close by and an easy ride into Manhattan. We even walked from the apartment into town, quite a few times, over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. Lila herself was a great host and very responsive with any communication. Honestly, unless you are hell-bent on staying in the thick of it, which we were not, you won't do better than this apartment. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks again Lila for a wonderful stay.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We enjoyed our short stay in that amazing place very much! Lila was very easy to communicate with and very helpful. Lila's place is exactly as described on Airbnb. Very spacious and clean, located in a quiet neighbourhood in central Brooklyn. Kitchen is basic but still enough equipped for cooking a pasta dish or soup - but regarding all the nice restaurants so close by you wouldn't want to stay inside for cooking ;-) Overall our stay (with two little kids under age 3) was a very nice experience and we definitely can recommend Lila's place!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lila's apartment was a very welcome respite from the busy and noisy area of Mid Town which was the first half of our visit to New York.  We enjoyed 'living' in a characteristic Brooklyn neighbourhood and with the close proximity to two subway lines and the fabulous neighbourhood cafes and restaurants that were so close, the apartment was the perfect place for us to relax and enjoy the peacefulness.  Lila was extremely quick to respond to my questions and was very accommodating with suggestions of activities etc.  The Welcome Book was full of information and ideas as well as the excellent Brooklyn guide that was also provided and helped with our planning of what to see and do.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Location, cleanliness, convenience, amenities, Lila's place is the perfect Brooklyn home away from home. The neighborhood was incredible, so many fantastic restaurants, local watering holes, and shops. We really enjoyed Clinton Hill and our friends who live in Jersey/Queens who came to visit us fell in love with the neighborhood also, now they all want to move Clinton Hill! ;) There is no bedroom, it's like a studio setup which is fine and very NYC, however just good to know ahead of time. Also the bathroom is separated into a toilet behind 1 door and separate area for shower/sink behind another door. Both were tiny but for NYC standards we totally get it and it was not an issue at all. The back patio really adds to the element of the space, it was so peaceful and truly helped us appreciate all Brooklyn and borough life has to offer! We will be back :)</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This was one of the best airbnb's I've stayed at. The high ceilings makes the flat feel so much bigger than it really is, and Lila and Paul have done a stellar job at creating a comfortable and attractive environment. There was excellent communication with the hosts and speaking as a personal lover of label makers, I was very pleased to find that all the switches were clearly identified. Some might be surprised to find the only sink in the bathroom, but it was such a small detail I wouldn't really call it an inconvenience. The neighborhood is great and close to transportation. All in all, you won't be disappointed with your stay.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Great flat in a excellent location. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay there again. Communication was really easy and Lila went out of her way to help.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lila and Paul's space is why I love AirBnB; people who get hospitality, understand the value of a great experience, and create something that becomes one of the best parts of traveling in 2017. Lila was quick to respond and answer any questions we had, their place was impeccable, smart, and stylishly appointed. Getting in and out was a breeze, and the value was excellent. I highly recommend staying here if you're in the mood for an authentic local NYC experience.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We always have a great time when we stay at Lila's and Paul's. It's a lively neighborhood with great restaurant choices, but very quiet for NYC with little street noise. Yet it's easy to get in and out of Manhattan on the C train. The space, as always, was extraordinarily clean. And Lila is so thoughtful with all the snacks and wine and goodies. Couldn't recommend it more highly.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had an excellent (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Lila was great, and the unit was in excellent condition. The location was perfect for us -   quiet street, quiet unit, close to our daughter's apartment, close to the Claussen subway stop, close to good restaurants, small Bodegas, and an easy walk to our favorite coffee shop 'Choice'. The photos on the Airbnb site were very accurate.  As other reviewers have noted, and as can be seen on the photos, there is not a sink in the kitchen, only a small sink in the bathroom connected to the kitchen. Takes some getting used to, but not a problem at all. We definitely look forward to staying there again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great little property in Brooklyn with good food around and awesome place to explore while in the area.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We really enjoyed our stay here! The flat was comfortable, stylish, and clean, and we appreciate the thoughtful details like fresh flowers and bottomless supply of ground coffee beans. The neighborhood is easy to get to by subway and is full of charming brownstones and good food. Lila is a very kind and communicative host. She was super responsive to our questions and helped simplify our transfers by being flexible. To summarize, great place and great hosts!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Lila's place is in a beautiful brownstone. It's exactly what you imagine when you think \"\"New York Brownstone.\"\" It was gorgeous and on an amazingly quiet street with beautiful trees. I loved everything about this place. It's a good distance from the Williamsburg area</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Real good place, lovely decorated, clean and comfortable, even fresh flowers on the table. We felt coming home every evening, after visiting the Big Apple. Everything was perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our Brooklyn stay was fabulous. The apartment is very well located and easy walking distance to Subway Stations to get to other places in NY as well as being able to walk to other closer sights like Prospect Park (go to the Botanic Gardens if you love plants) and Brooklyn Bridge. The apartment is very comfortable, spacious and light filled. All amenities were as described and in good working order. One of the best Airbnb apartments I have stayed in</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We wouldn't hesitate to recommend Lila and Paul's apartment, it's just as beautiful as it appears in the pics and felt like home right away. It really is the kind of NY apartment you dream of staying in! The area is amazing too, on a beautiful and quiet street, we felt comfortable walking everywhere and when we did need to go a little further, the subway was really close by. As an added bonus for us there were quite a few vegan food places nearby, including a really sweet bar at the end of the street.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thanks Christopher and Shalyn for great hospitality. The house is very comfortable and pretty nice. It's very close to subway station about 10 minutes to Manhattan. Zuzu is very beatiful and smart dog =). We had a very good time and fun. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Chris and Shalyn's was our first Airbnb experience, and we are very happy with how everything worked out. The hosts were amazing and friendly, the place was clean and cozy and getting to Manhattan was super easy with express train just around the corner. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was our first experience with Airbnb and we are very happy with how everything worked out. Shalyn and Christopher were very nice and friendly, as well as Zuzu, their amazing dog. (very quiet)\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at Shalyn and Christopher's place was just perfect...the two of them are wonderful hosts, Zuzu is adorable, the appartment is very clean, quiet and cosy and the fruit juices at mr kiwi are yummy. I had a really good time.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Amazing place to stay! Super positive experience! We highly recommend this place and will definitely be back. We stayed there for 16 nights. We felt comfortable, tended-to, yet independent during our stay. All good things in once. Both the apartment and the host are very warm and very welcoming. The neighborhood is quiet. We felt always safe even when we got back late in the night. Just 5 min to the subway and 15 min to Manhatten. We can't say enough good about our stay!!! We think best feedback is always: See you next year! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was an amazing experience. This was the first time that I've used Airbnb and it was great! Only Christopher was there, but he made us feel like home! The room was exactly as we've seen on the photo's! The house was clean and the bed slept great. The location was lovely because the neighbourhood was nice, the supermarket was nearby, and you can get from the house to manhattan in like 15min! Yeah we had a great stay and I'm for 100% sure that I'll stay there again when I'm going to NYC again!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was our first time in both AirBnB and New York, and we couldn't asked for a better experience. The cozy nook is amazing, the mattress is great and the pillows very comfortable, there's space to put your bags up there too (we had two bag packs and one other bag and they fitted in perfectly). We could only meet Christopher, since Shalyn was out of town working, but he sure took the time to made us feel like home. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>excellent accommodation I highly recommend !!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Christopher is such a great guy! He really made my boyfriend and I feel welcome in his home. He is very easy-going and friendly, and he has a very cute and lovely dog which we came to be very good friends with. He was busy with work but still he found time to hang with us and cook breakfast for us. His home is just as it is shown on the pictures - cozy, clean and warm. It is very easy to go from his apartment to Manhattan, and we especially liked spending time in Williamsburg which his home is very close to. We can absolutely recommend other to live at Christopher's! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Christopher, Zuzu and his beautiful little cozy place in Brooklyn made our first time in New York an awesome experience !! The place looks exactly like in the pictures and we really liked hanging out there. The area is really vibrant since bushwick is an upcoming neighborhood with a cool flair to it. Cool Bars, awesome restaurants and cute little cafes are all in walking distance and make you totally forget about manhattan. Getting to manhattan is really easy though since there a two jmz train stations around the corner. So you can get there basically any day- or nighttime ! Williamsburg with its endless opportunities to hang out, shop or drink is also right around the corner. Christopher as a host was just the best. He totally made us feel welcome at his place !! communication beforehand was also really good and easy as well. He sometimes even made breakfast for us in the morning. When we came home after a long trip of sightseeing in manhattan we sometimes just hung out together with a couple of beers, talking about basically everything. It felt more like friends visiting a friend. I can totally recommend this place on every level. So thank you again Christopher for this great experience ! Oh yeah and Zuzu is really just the best =) </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>As first experience with airbnb it was amazing! Christopher was so nice and friendly..he let us taste the real best american food :) Thanks a lot Christopher! The apartment comfortable, clean and located near the subway, so very easy to reach every spot! Zuzu the dog also very nice, quiet and obedient that gave us High 5! We had enjoyed so much this trip in NY and would like to return. Super recommended!!!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We spent an excellent time in NYC ! \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing experience in Brooklyn. Christopher's place was just what we needed for our time there and he was such a nice guy. My favorite Airbnb experience yet!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Clean and easily accessable space. Interesting loft beds, good amenities with provided soap and tea, all in all a good stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Really nice apartment, looks as good as the photos. It gets really busy since it's Times Square. If you are staying longer than a couple of days, the host asks that you pay for electricity.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Georgia’s place is top notch. I️ stayed there for a full month and hope to stay again. Exactly as described in the listing. Clean, perfect location, spacious, good view. Excellent staff downstairs. Plenty of sleeping space for guests. Lots of linens, blankets, towels, etc. Super fast internet and good cable service. Washer & dryer in the unit is so convenient. Georgia is very nice and hospitable. Had everything I️ needed in the apartment and Georgia was responsive to any questions. Can’t say enough—excellent NYC experience!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My boyfriend and I really really enjoyed our stay at Doria's apartment. It was clean, centrally located and incredibly welcoming. The location is amazing, with the subway close by and everything you could need within walking distance. She even left us some coffee for the mornings. Doria was easy to reach during our stay and I would stay here again for my next trip to NYC! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Doria's place is really cozy, clean and convenient to amazing lower East side bars and restaurants. She was an extremely responsive host which made my last minute booking quite seamless!\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My friend and I stayed at Doria's place for 2 weeks during the Christmas break. We felt at home right from the start. The location is ideally located being within 5-10 min walk from SoHo (for restaurants and shopping) and right in the center of LES where one can find clubs, speakeasy, restaurants and shops. Actually I would recommend to anyone the bar/restaurant GOTO right next door. They make excellent cocktails. I would definitely stay again at this place and recommend it to anyone who wants to visit NY.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed at Barbara's apartment for approximately one month. Overall, staying with Barbara was not a bad experience. When I had questions or issues, she generally would try to help me. The closet was furnished with a good number hangers and the dresser had extra linens. The furniture was very useful for organizing my items for my extended stay. She also provided a trash can and umbrellas (extremely useful for the rainy weather here in New York!). The water in the shower heats up very quickly.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Barbara made my stay in Williamsburg extremely welcomed. The room fits the description exactly. Very cozy. Also I loved the fire place so much looks very vintage! And not only because of the lovely room but also Barbara herself. She even prepared me a croissant one day morning for breakfast. She sent me a whole list of interesting places to go around in Williamsburg. And when I failed to open the door she came back to the apt and opened the door for me right away. All in all, I love Barbara's place and she is also a really good friend. I'm grateful I stayed with her! Highly recommend! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Barbara was an amazing host. I spent my birthday there and she even gave me TWO slices of cake (which were very tasty). I would recommend anyone stay with her. She gave us a list of neighborhood eats and activities, which was so useful.  She was an extremely accommodating and helpful host. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Really good area - super close to Union Square and nice sunny room. Didn't really hang out with Barbara since she was super busy, but she seems really nice.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Barbara was a wonderful host! I felt welcome right away. The room was just as I expected - great space for a month long stay. Barbara was away for part of my stay but was kind enough to invite me to a bbq she hosted with her friends. All around good experience.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had a great stay at Barbara's house. Room was clean and comfortable, Barbara is a great host and very helpful. Location is amazing as well and close to subway. Would definitely stay there again! Thank you Barbara!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fanny and her family gave us a very warmth welcome ! Great Location, two blocks away from the metro. Nice neighborhood with animation and good places to eat at reasonable price. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fany is a delightful person. She made me feel welcome. I love that this room is her daughter's who is away at college and that she is using the money from AirBnb to help cover college expenses. It made me feel good knowing that. This is exactly what AirBnB is supposed to be about- helping hard working families while providing a welcome guest experience. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Fany was an excellent host. She was warm and friendly and available to take care of anything you need. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The experience at Fany's house was awesome. The family is very friendly and always in a good mood. We arrived late, around 2am and they received us very happy. In addition, the room is really good, the bed is comfortable and the idea of having a fridge inside the room is really good. Thank for the time at your place.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Fany and her family were amazing hosts who made us feel right at home with their friendly hospitality. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her place which is conveniently located near the subway and is very clean and cosy. However, the traffic can get a bit noisy, and it is a 5 storey climb. Regardless, I would definitely return should I visit again in future. Thanks, Fany!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fany welcomed us warmly and was very helpful in letting us know how to get to some places that we were interested in visiting. His husband was also helpful in letting us know where to go eat. The minibar in the room was really useful! However, the room was really hot because of the heat, and the A.C did not work unfortunately (we opened the windows and was good this way, but it got too noisy when you sleep at night with a window open). Other than that, the bed was comfy and the location was convenient since it was near to coffee shops and metro. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The previous reviews are spot on true, so it would be redundant to repeat all the many positive descriptions.  However, if one discounts the fact that one is paying, staying at the Heras' Washington Heights apartment is like visiting your Latino relatives--Ecuadorian American--that you like a lot who put you in their college-age daughter's bedroom and shower you with grace and good will.  The bed was comfortable, and the neighborhood is convenient. These are genuinely gracious and friendly people that are excellent hosts.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Fanny and her husband are excellent hosts, they made me feel very welcome and respected my privacy. This is a great area, lots of cheap restaurants and feels very safe. Very convenient for the  subway.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Fany was an excellent host! She was very welcoming and attentive to my needs! The location is great. Very close distance to the subway. Room and bed were very comfortable and she even provided essentials. Highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fany's place is quite cozy. She and her family are extremely gracious and kind people. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to other travelers. Please note that there isn't a lift in her building and she's on the fifth floor. So, it's a good idea to travel light. :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Friendly, a good deal of privacy, welcoming, positive vibes throughout my stay...loved the dogs and cat,,,,appreciated hostess and her daughters chat before I left,,,,a very good value, fascinating, diverse neighborhood with a strong family ties evident during my many walks in quite safe spot!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Fany is by far one of the most welcoming hosts I've stayed with through Airbnb.  She truly cares about the wellbeing of her guests, she made sure I was comfortable, she was cheerful and friendly and I felt like I could talk to her about anything.  Unfortunately, my stay was too short, but I would love to return.  The room itself is quite spacious for New York standards.  The bed is perfect, there's a small tv, and I was surprised to find that it was quiet.  The neighborhood is lively and you have two subway lines to choose from.  I had an excellent stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fany was a great and considerate host. She and her family were kind and welcoming. The room looks just like on the pictures, the bed is comfortable and the neighbourhood safe. The A Train is  very close, a good place to explore Manhattan!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Best air bnb in NY, so close to the  subway with lots of shops, bars and restaurants around. Fany was a great host and was very easy to contact, her daughter was very helpful too. The room has absolutely everything, there is nothing this lady has forgotten, shampoo, conditioner, earplugs, body lotion, razor, nail varnish, shaving cream, hair dryer, guide books, snacks and water, the list goes on. Also the bed is big and the a/c is good. Everyone in the area is super friendly! Felt like home, I will return!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It is a good place for what it is worth. Close subway entrances. Somewhat good neighborhood. Has alot of things near by.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Helena's Mother was waiting at the apartment door with the keys when we arrived. The apartment was lovely and very well equipped, and very clean. There was good information in a file about the equipment in the apartment (TV, etc), and activities in the neighbourhood. This was our first experience of Airbnb and all in all a very good experience.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The listing was accurate, it was in a good/central location. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Convenient place on a budget in Brooklyn. It is cozy and spacious so you will feel very comfortable here. Rebecca gets messages fast so there's good communication. It will take about 30/40min to get to Manhattan but the subway station is quite close.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thanks to Brenda and yacine both of them are very good host . The place is very Nice . The location is perfect . The best place i éver booked in nyc . I will be back for sure</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Brenda has been a good and very available host when needed. The apartment is very convenient for a stay in NY, and very well situated close to several stores and 5 blocks away from the subway. The only \"\"bad\"\" thing I can say is that the bedroom carpet is kind of old. We enjoyed our stay there and I will definitely come back.\"</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I cannot believe how wonderful our stay was at Brenda's place. It was a beautiful place lots of room for both my friend and I. The beds were so very comfortable and we felt safe at all times. The place was perfect for our needs, close to the Subway station, excellent food at Sylvia's a short walk away and despite the odd hours we were keeping, getting up at 4am or coming back at 6am our host was very understanding. The street itself was beautiful and tree lined and we did enjoy having access to the back garden area even though our schedule gave us very little time to enjoy it. Brenda and her daughter were the perfect hosts, checking in from time to time, providing bottled water, which we were very grateful for as it was so hot the week we were there. The air conditioning units helped to keep out oasis cool and comfortable. They also respected our privacy and made sure to text or ring the doorbell before entering. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here if you are planning an extended stay and I do hope to be able to visit and stay again in the future. This place is a real gem and so are Brenda and her lovely daughter.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Brenda was welcoming and quick to reply to all my pre-trip questions. The apartment is in a good location to explore NYC. There are lots of places to eat and shop close by too. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The amazing Harlem apartment is indeed amazing, and Brenda and Yacine are wonderful hosts. The street is quiet, but less than 1/2 a block to bustling Lenox/Malcolm X, with restaurants, coffee shops, groceries, bodegas, laundry, etc. Short walk to 125th street, where you will find mainstream and local shopping, plus the historic Apollo theater, and the Studio Museum of Harlem, not to mention the subway. The bed is comfy, the kitchen well-equipped...and walking past the little garden every day is just a delight! This is ideal for my trip, thanks Brenda and Yacine!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Another great stay at my favorite Harlem hideaway. Astor Row was resplendent in autumn colors, lovely! Jacob Soul Food buffet for salad bar and soul food was my mainstay this time, but I splurged on Red Rooster and Sylvia's - all walking distance! Can't beat Astor Row Cafe for excellent coffee and Balthazar pastries. The apartment was a warm and cozy respite from the chill of the New York fall. Thank you for everything, Brenda and Yacine!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything in this apt was just perfect. I stayed for a month and I really enjoyed it. Yacine and Brenda were great hosts, always reachable and always willing to help or to check if everything was ok, which is very convenient. The apt is very spacious, clean, comfortable, uncluttered, with big closets, quiet,... I can't think of anything negative. Bed was comfy, tv with cable, good wifi, lots of sheets and towels, kitchen had everything you need to cook a decent meal, bathroom is small but shower was good and I had enough space for my toiletries. I didn't used the patio because of the weather but I'm sure in the summer it should be a great place to hang out. The street is lovely, and neighborhood is very live. Close to the subway, a supermarket open almost until midnight, nice restaurants, shops and 5 minute walk to the busiest street of Harlem, 125th, near the Apollo Theatre and other subway lines. Great location, great host, great apt. Perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A nice, cozy and well equipped apartment.  Fridge, freezer, microwave and stove. Small but clean bathroom with good hot water. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was very well situated, close to many public transport options as well as plenty good restaurants & cafés and still in a nice quiet street. The place was very clean and had everything that you might need. Yacine and her mother were friendly and quick to respond and checked in to ask if everything was OK. The stay was great, thanks for everything!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Enjoyed the stay !!! The apartment is extremely comfortable, the reception was great, the location is perfect and the quiet and quiet of the street and the apartment are amazing. As I often needed to work the apartment, the comfort and tranquility for me, made the difference.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Yacine has been such a kind host. The position is good (five minutes to the 125th stop of the tube), and the apartment was clean. Recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Clean, friendly, cozy, private, safe....Can't say enough good things!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Yacine & Brenda are absolutely amazing. This is my second time staying with them and you couldn’t ask for better hosts! The home is a great size for 2-3 adults. It’s conveniently located to shops, subways, and restaurants. The home itself is so incredibly charming and truly worth its value.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My daughter and I found this to be a fantastic base for exploring New York City. The location is excellent, being an easy subway ride to Times Square, and Harlem itself has plenty to enjoy. The apartment is comfortable, secure, spacious and well-equipped. We loved it!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place is really good. Ideal for two persons. It has one bed and a sofa, but both are really comfy. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Je recommande , l'hôte est très gentille ,toujours prête à rendre service , j'ai passé un excellent séjour </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Brenda's place was amazing. T.V. in the front and bedroom room. Plenty of room especially for an NY place. If i'm ever in the area, this will be the place I look to stay. Great safe location with easy access to the train, food, and stores.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lovely apartment, pictures are accurate. Very clean and comfortable. We weren't there a huge amount as we're wanting to explore the city but esmahan and Jacob were good hosts and some good ideas for where to go on the wall of the room :). Great having pets in the place as well. Room didn't have a external window but as the apartment is so light and airy this wasn't a problem. Overall a brilliant stay and very close to transport links and places to eat and drink. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My experience with Esmahan and Jacob was really good. I had complete privacy, the bed was comfy and I slept really well. They provided toiletries and fun skin care stuff. They were super mellow and relaxed, the vibe of the place was cool and hip. I would totally stay here again. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great stay at Esmahan and Jacob’s place! The room was spacious, fully equipped with TV, coffee machine, some information about subways and the nearest places to eat. The bed was large and very comfortable. They also provided some towels and toiletries. The apartment itself was very clean and cosy. It’s situated in a very calm and quiet neighborhood, subways are nearby with very good connections. We had a lot of privacy. Esmahan and Jacob are very nice and friendly people, the dog and the cat are lovely too! Overall we would recommend this apartment, a perfect place for a city trip in the big apple.   </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It's been a great stay (place) and a great encounter (E+J)! The room is spacious and equipped with everything you need (including towels), not to mention the nice info they provide about local spots/places and transport. The bed is a comfy double size. Overall, the apartment is pretty much clean and cosy and it's located in a very relaxed area, close to different subway connections. Esmahan and Jacob are great people: hopefully we'll meet again in the future and share some good time together! Max (dog) and Mao (cat) are great companions ;) what more could I say? I definitely would recommend staying  at E+J if you're visiting NYC. Great Experience. Thanks a lot and...'till soon! m&s</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique has a nice and cozy house in the Lower East side, nearby the Williamsburg Bridge. The surrounding area is quite multicultural and alive, I never had a problem coming back alone late in the night. The metro is 4 minutes away so it's very convenient. About the host: Veronique is a very nice host, she gave me lots of useful advice for visiting NYC, and she also lends you lots of maps and other useful things. I had a great time in NYC, I was very busy so we did not meet many times, but I would recommend staying at her place. The good-sized private room has everything you need: a comfortable bed, a desk, mirror etc. You probably might need to be comfortable with cats as her nice black cat comes around sometimes and wants to play, but for me this was nice and not a problem. Afterall my judgement is positive and I would definitely recommend staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a wonderful time staying two nights at Véronique's Lower East Side apartment. It's in a lovely area full of great restaurants, cafes, bars, and awesome dessert shops. (If you have time go to Morgenstern's Finest Ice Cream down the road, so good!). Véronique was a lovely host and made sure I was comfortable and was open if I had any questions or concerns. Also she has a cat who is a warm furball of cute. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Véronique is a very kind person. The room is very nice and the location good. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique is extremely nice and accommodating, and her apartment is well located for Lower East Side explorations. You feel very much like a local here.  The apartment itself is small, but covered all the bases, felt safe and has a comfortable bed. It is a good option for budget accommodations with a lot of local flare. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Véronique est une très bonne hôte,  pleine de conseils et d'attentions pour vous mettre à l'aise.  Son appartement très bien situé permet de profiter au maximum de son séjour. Très chaleureux notamment grâce à Réglisse,  adorable petite chatte qui vous accueille avec tendresse ! Je recommande Véronique,  mon séjour a été excellent !</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Véronique's place is  great. Location is perfect, walking distance to a number of good shops and food place. The heating in the house is good. Cat is cute and friendly. I will stay at her place again. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Veronique made me feel welcome. The location was amazing, and the room was good. The cat was a little crazy, albeit cute. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A very small bathroom and I even can't turn around. The cat sleep on the bed when nobody there, and it's noisy at the midnight.. And I wake up all the night per hour. My goodness.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>J'ai passé un excellent séjour chez Véronique! Le quartier est génial, intéressant et sûr. L'appart est douillet et Véronique est une excellente hôtesse, accueillante, dispo, détendue et qui connait parfaitement NY et a plein de bonnes idées pour des activités ou des moyens d'économiser quelques $$$.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My stay in the home of Véronique was excellent.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good place to stay! Nice neighbourhood ! Will defenetly go back ! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Veronique it's a excellent host and provide everything that I need to be comfortable at home...she was honest about that apartment it's on the 5th floor and it's important for those who travel with big luggage...the room was very cozy indeed, the neighborhood was very good/safe and the location it's excellent...I strongly recommend Veronique as host and the it's bedroom for those who look for NY to visit!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td> Véronique was very friendly and helpful and her cat was cute. The appartment was very comfortable and clean. The neighborhood was safe and the location was excellent. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good place to stay for few days on NYC! The apartment (mainly the WC) is very tiny (as Veronique describes) but the room and the bed have a good size. After all, when u are in NYC u don't use to stay in the apartment but enjoying the city! Veronique is very helpful and pleasant! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a good and very cozy place to stay. Véronique was so kind and accepted my quite late check-in. The room is a nice size for NY City and bed felt very comfortable. As I was traveling super light, Véronique offered to me toiletry basics I am very grateful for. The bathroom space is very small and I managed to bump into things very easely:) With that said I would definitely recommend this place to stay in! Véronique suggested to me an amazing breakfast place just a short walk from her home, which was one of the best in my life! Ask her for that if you want to spend a great day without thinking of food!:) Thank you, Véronique!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Beautiful cozy bedroom in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The accommodation provides everything that you need for a trip to New York City. It is located close to several bars and restaurants as well as to bus and subway stations of the New York public transportation network. Véronique is a really great host taking good care of her guests from all around the world. I would definitely use the accommodation again for a future stay in New York City.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique is welcoming and pleasant person! The house is a great place to feel New York's true life. It is historical place with very good location. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great stay, Veronique and Reglisse were very welcoming ! As described - the accommodation is good, clean, cozy with comfortable bed and located in a nice neighborhood with good places to eat (bakery down the road, highly recommanded !) + subway around the corner ! It's on the fifth floor, bear in mind if you are travelling with heavy luggages but you will get used to the stairs after a few days :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique's place was charming and full of character. It is a compact space but has everything you need. Well connected, quiet and in a diverse central neighbourhood. Very good communications and easy arrival / departure. The cat is delightful and very friendly to visitors. The room itself is the opposite side of the flat from the host so you have a good degree of privacy. I enjoyed my brief stay and would come back in future. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique was such a good host, so welcoming! The room was a perfect size and it was really easy to come and go from the apartment between exploring New York! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique is a sweetheart and very welcoming.  The room is cozy and clean and has all the basics you will need for a good night's sleep!  I would highly recommend staying if you want the LES experience. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had a great time at Véronique's place after I missed my flight. The location of her flat was amazing - in lower east side you can find anything you want and it only takes few minutes of walk to the subway. And with her lovely lovely cat made my stay there just perfect. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Véronique’s place is what Air BnB is all about! If you want somewhere spacious, modern and hotel-like, then this is not for you; but Veronique makes this clear from the listing and the message I received before booking. This place really has character; I felt like I was staying with a friend, living in a really cool little corner of New York which is full of history. Veronique was friendly and had good recommendations for what to do in the local area, and it was lovely to have a little chat with her at the end of a long day exploring. Yes, it's quirky, but for me that adds to the charm and I would definitely stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Véronique's place made my trip to New York. I stayed with her and Reglisse the cat for four nights, and really enjoyed the neighborhood and easy access to the subway. What is even better is that the apartment is surrounded by so many delicious places to eat and drink - I didn't even get to the all the places I wanted to in time. Véronique is also so welcoming, I felt quite at home while I was here. The room is very comfortable, private, and has a desk to use as work space. Wifi worked flawlessly. Really good value, and great way to experience NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique is really nice and easy to communicate, the space is really small but has a good location. Ideal if you are just looking for a place to crush</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veronique and her cat are great hosts.  Even though we didn't interact that much with her because we spend most of our time walking out the city, she was very open to questions and she explained to us in detail the apartment rules once we arrived to her place (i.e. not use the AC on High or move the cat litter from the shower.)  The place is really close to a metro station that took us to most of the touristic places of the city without changing the line; F or J lines took us to both Uptown and Downtown very fast, Little Italy and Chinatown are walking-distance and the Williamsburg Bridge is just a couple blocks away, so you can walk directly to Brooklyn's heart.  There are A LOT of great places to eat (Kat's Deli is just about few blocks away from the apartment!!) and for coffee lovers, there's a Blue Bottle Coffee shop right next to the building entrance.  My girlfriend and I agree that this is a good if you are just looking for a place to crush.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Véronique is an excellent host and makes guests feel very welcome. Within the first few minutes of arriving it felt as though I was staying with a friend! The location was brilliant, with loads of great restaurants within a very short walk. There are good public transport links too, although I found it a lot more fun to explore on foot. I felt really safe and comfortable here. The room is really quiet too, I couldn't hear any traffic noise and slept brilliantly on the very comfortable bed. Reglisse the cat is adorable and very affectionate. I stayed for one week and wish I was staying longer!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great host! Veronique was able to let me add a guest for one night and was very receptive to any questions I had. Room was clean and a good size.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Quirky NY apartment on the Lower East Side.  Veronique was easy to get in touch with and was very welcoming and a great host all around!  The neighborhood has lots of nightlife (not so much my scene) and the apartment is very convenient to multiple train lines, Midtown, Brooklyn, etc etc.  It is a 5th floor walk up and the bed is lofted so only good for those who don't mind a little climbing!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I got a good night sleep. Perfect for a short stay in the city. Véronique was easy going and welcoming. Thanks</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a great time in Veronique's house. It was exactly what I needed, quiet time and beautiful host. Thank you Veronique for everything you did for me and the great hospitality. The place is in good location and the space is just enough for short time stances.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Leslie and Sharon are the perfect host, They have excellent independent apartment at very good location. Everything for your daily needs is just 5 mins away.. We (with my wife and little kid) enjoyed a lot there.. this is perfect place with perfect price. Thanks Leslie and Sharon for such a wonderful experience!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a great time in Leslie's apartment. Very clean and tidy. I had directions around town left on the table. Nice neighborhood too with a good park nearby. Leslie is also responsive!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The stay was excellently pleasant...very nice and large very clean, and beautifully placed near a park</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice, clean room with bright windows and a comfortable big bed with lots of pillows! Ezra is a really cool guy, spontaneous, welcoming and answered all my questions and mails directly! Also Bill, the roommate is really friendly, cool, relaxed and helpful and I had a really good time talking to him or having a beer out in one of the bars in Williamsburgh! The location is pretty good as you have a train station (J,M,Z), supermarkets, delis and laundromats only 5min (Website hidden by Airbnb) go to Manhattan you only need like 15-20min. I had an awesome time and if I come back I'll surely contact Ezra and Bill again!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Will was a great host and his loft really is amazing. It was a great space to spend a couple weeks. The daylight in the room is great and the bed is really comfortable. Will was also very easy to communicate with even as he was abroad in Brazil. The only downside to the apartment is that the walls are remarkably thin so I could pretty much hear everything his roommate was doing and I felt bad waking up in the morning if he was still sleeping or coming back after a night out. Otherwise, it was a great space and a fun neighborhood to spend a couple weeks. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I just want to thank El for being an amazing host, he was incredibly accommodating and told us really good spots to eat at and experience the local neighborhood, even how to travel around NY. He is a super chill dude, easy to talk to and keeps his place clean. I definitely made a new friend this trip and would recommend El Davis to anyone!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We haven't met Nora herself because she was on vacation. But her roommate was there for us and gave us good recommendations. The location is great, but you have to walk 10 minutes to both of the subwaystations. Good equipped kitchen ;-) \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My host was amazing even from a distance! Her apartment was very cozy and I felt right at home. The location was also perfect as it was right off the 2/3 train stop. Would definitely recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I want to live here forever! The building itself is super great! Cass is the best host ever and the sweetest. Her place was so comfortable and the energy felt so good in here with the nice breeze that comes in when you open the window. It's so spacious for a studio and had everything I needed to be comfortable. Thank you so much Cass!!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Cassandra was awesome! At all times (before, during and after) he was available and helped us with whatever we needed. If I come back to NYC I will stay at your house of course! His house has easy access to the subway station and also it’s so near about a very good coffe place nearby. Cass, thanks for everything and happy Thanksgiving :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My friends and I were lucky enough to book Cassandra's apartment for our trip to NYC over Christmas and New Year's. Working with her was super easy. She sent videos prior to our checkin to go over details of the checkin and the apartment which I thought added a nice personal touch. She also offered some good recommendations for food and things to do in local Harlem. The location was excellent and everyone we talked to in the building and the surrounding neighborhood were super friendly! The apartment is also really close to the subway and downtown is a quick 15-20 train ride away.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>An excellent place to stay when visiting NYC.. everyone in the block was friendly and it’s located a few footsteps away from tube station and a few streets from main shops in Harlem.. Cass was always very helpful and responsive</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>nice house, Cass was kind and warm,given me good advice. the room is clean and spacious, It's easy to cook, there's a supermarket downstairs, convenient transportation. Perfect trip to New York</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"After 2 1/2 weeks in New England we were doing a quick stop in New York for 24 hours.  Ruby was absolutely amazing!  She knew our time-frame was short and was incredibly helpful in giving us ideas to maximize our stay in New York City!  She stayed in communication with us when we needed it and was very respectful of our space as well.  Her place is immaculate!  The perfect place to come \"\"home\"\" to after being out and about in New York City.  She was generous with her home and her extensive knowledge of the city.  I can give nothing but raving reviews of Ruby and her beautiful home.  If you want the taste of being a true New Yorker and still feel a bit pampered</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ruby is an amazing host, very willing and full of stories to tell. She is very helpfull and gives a lot of advices for the visit of Manhattan.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My friends and I rented Ruby's apartment for our 4-day stay in NYC. We wanted to have the whole NYC experience and thought an apartment rental would be perfect.  The whole experience was amazing! We all had room to sleep comfortably and had everything we needed. Since we arrived after her work hours, Ruby was able to pick us up from the airport and take us back (it was a holiday) for a cheaper fee than we would have paid for a cab. Ruby is an absolute sweetheart, the place is nice and roomy, and we will be booking with her the next time we visit the city. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My family and I stayed at Ruby's apartment for 6 days. We got the warm welcome from her. She also managed to pick us up and take us back to the airport with the cheap fee. Her hospitality made us feel like home. The place was absolutely comfortable for four of us. My parents like the full functional kitchen and vary kitchen utensils. We also enjoyed cooking together there. During our stay, we were not allowed to access to the wash room but Ruby took our clothes to wash and dry for us. The place is in the middle of 2 subway stations (3 lines). Walking 0.6 miles to the subway is not a big deal for us because we like to walk. Overall, we like her place. Thank you Ruby for being a very good host for us. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This was an amazing experience! Ruby was a great host, particularly with the large group of us! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ruby was very welcoming and helped us when we needed it and recommended us to some great spot in New York.  A lovely home in a very peaceful location in Brooklyn, New York. Ruby had an amazing bathroom that my group and I loved. In addition , Ruby also picked us up and took us back to the NYC with a reasonable fee. Thanks!\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Such a wonderful space!! Everything was nice and clean. The communication and response time with any questions I had was immediate. I rented Ruby's space for one night to host a surprise dinner for my girlfriend and some of her friends. Everyone had an amazing time and her home was just perfect. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Ruby and her daughter were great hosts ..they had everything we needed she helped us get around she answered any questions told us where to shop to eat have a good time.. overall great experience we will be returning soon</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a wonderful stay! It was very central to the areas I needed to visit. It is a wonderful place. It offers a great common area to just have good conversation while either listening to music or watching tv. The hot water was amazing. I wanted to take some home with me. The bed are very comfortable and it feels like home. She provided great communication before my stay and during my stay. It was a very smooth process. She is a wonderful host and I'm sure she will be a super host soon. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The stay was beyond amazing! We all loved Ruby's AirBnB. The apartment was very spacious & clean! Ruby even offered us mimosas on the morning of our arrival. We hope to return one day and stay again! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was a pretty good value for our big group of 8. The apartment was as shown in photos and was clean and bright. About 10-15 min walk to the subway with kids. The only issue was finding parking, there is free street parking but not plentiful. One night it took 40 minutes to find a parking spot. I suggest not moving your car once you get there if possible and just walking/using public transportation. That was no reflection on the place or host but I'm assuming just part of being in such a huge city. Ruby was fabulous. She was so helpful and accommodating from the time I inquired about the apartment until after check out. She made us feel very welcomed.  We would stay again. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This place is so cute, very clean and comfortable. Great beds and you find everything you need. Ruby is a sweetheart and makes sure you are feeling good at all times, very easy to communicate with and has a lot of good recommendations of NYC. Would definitely recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>we had the best time at Ruby'apartment ! The place was very clean, warm and well equipped if you want to cook meals . The bed are very comfortable . The water pressure in the shower is great ( and that's very important for me ) . She did everything to make our stay as good as possible and had 2 sets of keys to give us . The location is very convenient close to th (Website hidden by Airbnb) and if you want to spend a night in, you can watch Netflix while sitting in a very comfortable couch !</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ruby was amazing, gave us recommendations to local hot spots in Brooklyn and New York. She let us drop our baggage off when we first got there which was early for check in and let us do a late check out. She is a 10/10, loved everything about the space.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a fantastic experience at Ruby’s place. I’ve stayed in a good number of AirBnbs all over the world and was touched by how home-y this apartment felt — family photos, recent magazines on the coffee table, etc. I also got a sense of community in the neighborhood, which I loved. Ruby herself was also very accommodating and responded quickly to my questions. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ruby was such a great host. As soon as we arrived she greeted us and gave us all the ins about Brooklyn, where to go out, the best food places and easiest way to get places. Always answered to when I called or texted. Her place was beautiful and up to date. Would definitely recommend to anyone, such an amazing stay and so homey.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My mom and her sisters had an amazing experience. Karen and her husband are wonderful hosts, they were easy to communicate with and were quick to answer all my questions and concerns. They even came to check on the ladies! The apartment was clean, well-equipped,  a close proximity to the city, and more importantly safe.  Overall, they had a wonderful time! \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great little flat, clean and tidy. Laurence is a good host too. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The apt is awesome and in an excellent location</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Laurence's apartment was great! Very clean and in an amazing location!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was a perfect place to stay at. He was very willing to work with our schedule and made our experience a very good one! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Lawrence's apartment was amazingly well located, and absurdly quiet and peaceful considering. I attended the \"\"lesbians who tech\"\" summit during my stay and enjoyed both the name of his wifi network and his books (Carol</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Laurence excepted our booking in very short notice- we needed to find a place for the same day- that was very helpful. Other than welcoming us in check in, we didn't see him, but he was very nice!  Although the apt is small in size, it is well organized so for 1 or 2 people it's great. The things i liked the most is the cool location and the cleanliness of the apt. The Minos of the place for me is the kitchen- not ideal for cooking meals indoor. But so many options to eat outside right next to the apt. To conclude-  we had a very good experience in the place and i recommend it  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was clean and in good order with fresh sheets and towels provided by Andres who met us at the apartment. It's very convenient to have only a few stairs, especially as we had our baby's pram with us. The living room and bedroom are fine sizes and in summer time the balcony would be great too.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a very good experience staying at Andres's place. It's the first time I stayed in Hell's Kitchen and really loved the area, particularly its proximity to Central Park, a Whole Foods market, Times Square, Grand central and Penn Station.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andres is a very good host, and he is really very accommodating and communicative. We did find a very clean and tidy apartment, equipped with every comfort and very well decorated. The house is also very delicious and extremely quiet, even though close to a fairly busy street. And the terrace on the back is great for dinner in the evening. And also it’s in a strategic position: almost two blocks from Times Square and a few meters from restaurants, metro, laundries, musicals and shops. You will have no problem to move, eat, go shopping... and especially it’s positioned in a safe and lit street at night (there’s a lot of security around there). It’s worth all the money you pay! See you next time in NYC Andres!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andrea is a very good and easy going person. His place is well located in NYC, very close to Times Square and good restaurants! If you are a tourists for several days in NYC, trust me this is a good choice!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great apartment and exactly as described. Clean, comfortable, well-equipped and in an ideal location - right in the theatre district surrounded by plenty of good restaurants and only 6 minutes walk to Times Square, with the subway just 2 minutes away. Thanks for a great stay Andres.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Si l'annonce vous plaît, alors vous ne serez pas déçu car à notre arrivée, nous avons découvert l'appartement tel que l'on a pu l'observer en photo: chaleureux, en excellent état, avec tout ce qu'il faut pour le quotidien.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Myself and a friend stayed in Andrés apartment for 5 days. As a first time traveller I was quite worried about the long distance travel. Andrés was really kind and welcoming and showed us around his apartment before taking off. We arrived to a clean, warm and comfortable apartment, with everything we needed. The location was perfect, walking distance to some amazing New York attractions. All in all we would definitely recommend this apartment to fellow travellers!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a short but good stay. We didn't met Andres but spoke with him by phone. Ivan, friend of Andres, helped us to find the apartment and gave us the keys. We took shower and went out to explore the city. It's a magic - to have such a nest in the real heart of New York city. Thank you, Andres, for comfortable apartment and hot shower! That what we needed and that what we got. Cleaning lady was also nice and friendly to us (as Ivan). Excellent location. In a short walking distance from Times Square.  Good choice for a short stay in the NYC! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good internet, great location, out of the chaos of NYC but just a walking distance from it. Were able to do an early check in. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>As good as it is!\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My husband and I had an excellent stay in this apartment. The location is incredibly convenient, the apartment furnishings comfortable and the neighborhood includes everything needed for a perfect stay-a variety of restaurants, the subway, a grocery store and shopping yet  providing a sense of neighborhood. The location lends itself to easy access by foot or subway to all of New York's tourist attractions. The apartment can easily accommodate two to four people. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andreas was the best host! We booked last minute and he was able to get us in quickly and cleaned the apartment spotless before we arrived and the last guest left. The apartment is in a perfect location for visiting the city. Great place for couples the patio was great to sit and drink wine at the end of day. Air conditioning kept the place at a perfect temperature. Truly an amazing first time with Air BnB I would definitely recommend staying with Andreas if your visiting the city. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I was in new york for a 3 day family vacation and this place was perfect in every sense for me. The location is just walk away from times square, which makes it easy for elder poople to avoid travel hassle. The apartment is well maintained and clean with all the facilities which we can expect from a vacation home. Andreas is a great host as he also took great care of our luggage due to early check in. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good vacation in new york.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Where to begin, Location Location location!  This place is in the heart of the city. My partner and I stayed here for a week and absolutely loved it. It's in a neighborhood with a lot of great restaurants and amazing bars all within walking distance. Times Square is a few short blocks away as is Broadway, Rockefeller Center, The Empire State building, shopping on 5th ave, Central Park, Bryant park and sooooo many other attractions. The subway is half a block away. The apartment looks just like the pictures shown. Clean and comfortable. The patio is very nice to have! It was a great place to sit outside, have coffee, and enjoy the quiet before rushing off into the noisy city streets. We met Andres and he showed us to the apt as soon as we got into the city. He even recommended some Broadway shows and restaurants to go to, which we did and all were amazing recommendations. All in all we would definitely stay here again. Great and easy find.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This apartment was PERFECT!!!! First off, the location can't be beat. It's close to everything a visitor to NYC needs. It was my mother (75), myself (50) and my daughter (16). I mention ages because I didn't want my mother to have to endure a 3 to 4 floor walk up and my daughter left the apartment, camera in hand, to explore the surrounding neighborhood without me worrying. A block away is the Amish market (excellent grocery). Two to three blocks-several subway and bus lines going up and downtown and Times Square.  15-20 minute walks to the Circle line, Central Park, MOMA, Rockefeller Center. Also a bike share right across the street-I rode the bike down the Westside highway to the beginning of the Highline, walked thru it then biked home. Perfect!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is nice and we didn't hv any problems. The location of the building is pretty good but the apartment itself is at the back of the building at the end of a corridor and therefore there is hardly any natural light coming in. Please also confirm with Andreas about the check in since there seem to be some special requirements for that. Ou stay was very comfortable though and I wld like to thank Andreas for everything!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Perfect for us..lovely outside space...and sunny....with full moon too! we felt like a resident of New York. Very comfortable and good to have a separate room for our son.Very helpful with our luggage arrangements!Thanks you.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andreas sent a complete packet of helpful information before we arrived. It was very easy to pick up the keys and check-in as well as check-out. The apartment looks exactly like it did in the photos. It was the perfect space for 3 people. The location was amazing. Walking distance to Times Sq, many shops and restaurants. The C,E subway lines were right on the corner and the N,R subways not to far away.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andres' apartment was perfect. Clean, quiet and comfortable, the location couldn't be beat for a theater (or any tourist) trip. Check in was easy and the communication was good. Very short walk to tons of restaurants, theaters, the subway, Central Park, Rock Center, etc. Would stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good location on the edge of Times Square District. Small but neat and comfortable. Andreas is a good host and when a water leak occurred he was right there to mop and do his best to make things right. You'll need to be aware of limitations to dropping off luggage etc, but I found Andreas easy to work with. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"A great apartment in a fantastic location. A short walk from Times Square and a stone's throw from the best theatres. Despite that, the apartment is quiet and there was no noise from the busy city outside. The apartment is a good size, with a bright bedroom and balcony as described, and comfortable sofa bed in the living room. The kitchen is well-equipped with essential items such as a large fridge, coffee machine and cooker. Cable TV and WiFi were also provided. We had good communication with our host Andres by (Hidden by Airbnb) : He gave good directions, and responded quickly to any questions (such as \"\"How do we work the TV?\"\"). If you are looking for a stay in the heart of the city</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Apartment is in an amazing location. Really accessible to Times Square and surrounding areas. We arrived late in the evening but key pick up was swift and had good contact with Andreas. There was a leak in the apartment during our stay, however Andreas came round to sort it in 10minutes (this however shouldn't put anyone off staying here). The apartment gave us an real insight into New York living and was a refreshing change to hotels. Would recommend! Thanks Andreas!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location! Apartment was good to sleep and shower in. Nothing fancy but very comfortable and the perfect location.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andreas was in good communication with us and organised for someone to meet us and let us in to the apartment on arrival. He was a little late due to subway delay. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The experience was good... but we will not stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andreas place is amazing!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at Andreas place was perfect for us. Close to transit, plenty of good food. Supermarket. Andreas made us feel at home. The apartment was bigger than I expected and very clean and comfortable. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>A very nice flat with an excellent location. Time's Square is a couple of minutes walk away and the closest subway station just as close. Andreas is a really helpful and trustworthy host.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Excellent location near times square, theaters and subway! Cosy apartments that felt homely and safe. Host was excellent- sent us a list of awesome restaurants & bars, as well as being really flexible with our check out time! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Photos and description were accurate. The apartment was tidy and the location is excellent. A hairdryer is available if needed. Great value.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing time in NY and enjoyed Andreas place a lot. The location is fantastic, minutes away form Central Park, 5 ave and Times Square. The place is small and cozy, but there is a problem with some nasty ants. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andreas had good communication and was there to receive us and even offered to pick up our luggage from the storage place if we so desired. The  check in is at 5 pm, which is kind of a let down. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Great apartment, well equipped, excellent location. We really enjoyed the patio as well, big plus. Andres was very responsive and made sure we settled well. Definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We loved our stay in NYC.  Andres was an excellent host.  Communication was excellent and the apartment exactly as advertised.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location, good tips from Andreas and easy access to transport. Well worth staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andreas was a wonderful host. Initially it took a few days to get a reply, once we started discussing/organising he was quick to reply. The place is very nice and looks exactly as in the pictures. It was clean, quiet, had plenty of plates/kitchen equipment etc. The shower dripped, and the sink tap had a patch that leaked, not big problems by any means. There is good food close by and close to Subway. Otherwise everything was as advertised and very comfortable. Would stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>An amazing apartment close to everything on a  relatively quiet street. Every detail was perfect. Andreas was kind, accommodating, and went out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect. It felt like home away from home. Thanks so much!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Fantastic flat just five minutes from Times Square.. and when I say 5 mins that is no exaggeration!  Yet, it is quiet and away from all of the activity.  Always felt safe walking to and from the flat.  It is perfect for 3 or 4 people.. the bed is comfortable and the pull out sofa was comfortable for my son as well.  Unit was clean and was as advertised.  There are bikes right across the street from the flat, which is the best way to get around the city!  Andres was an excellent host and very quick to respond to any of our needs.  Would stay at this place again and would recommend it to any of my friends looking for a place in this fantastic city.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>If you want to be close to the Broadway theaters and TImes Square, this is a good apartment to stay in. Andreas' apartment was well stocked with towels and the basics for cooking. The terrace is a wonderful amenity which is quite rare in New York. Bathroom may be small and tight for 4 guests but still doable. Delis, coffee shops and salad bars are near the apartment for meals and snacks. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Overall a great place to stay if you want to be near Broadway shows and some of the more touristy attractions.   I felt safe in the apartment and the surrounding neighborhood.  Lots of good food, with many small ethnic places to try.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was in a fantastic location close to Times Square (5 min walk) and 10 minutes from central park which was very convenient for me to go running around the park and then to go out in Times Square etc are night. Also very convenient to the subway to access to downtown (15 minutes) and Brooklyn (25 minutes). I felt much like I was living like a New Yorker in a apartment in the centre of everything. Lovely and quiet for those times you wanted to sleep in some mornings yet as i mentioned, so close to everything . I very much will come back again and would recommended to anyone wanting a nice comfortable apartment at a very good price close to the heart of manhattan!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was my first airbnb experience. I was a little skeptical, i tryed and it could not get better. Audrey is such a great person, she helped me in many things giving suggestion how to reach the apt from the airport in the cheapest way (Ny is so expencive in everything). She sent me a list good places for shopping, she even left a bottle of White wine for welcoming!! The apt is even better than the pics. It is so bright, neat and clean, quite great atmosphere. It is near to everything: restuarant, bar, market and above all the subway!! Wifi great, Audrey left us also pc, so we had possibility to work a little bit!!She is great! I strongly suggest this apt.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing time during our one month stay in Audrey's apartment! It's beautiful, spacious, well-lit and has effective climate control. Audrey was very warm, accommodating and flexible, and very prompt in responding to our communications. The location of the apartment has now become one of our favorite areas of Brooklyn due to the plethora of great restaurants and shops around easy access to the park and convenience to parts of Manhattan. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great apartment in a good, safe area of Brooklyn. Audrey was very responsive when we messaged her and helpful. For example, when we couldn't find an iron she ordered one straight away and it arrived the next day. I would recommend for anyone wanting some space in an apartment in New York (we kept all our 2 suitcases there as we had relocated from London comfortably). There are restaurants and bars a few minutes walk away but you can easily catch the subway into Manhattan (station is a few minutes walk only).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Devi's house has that \"\"Good people live here\"\" feel.  The new futon must be unusually good quality</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice hosts and good neighborhood. Room as described. Maybe next time we will stay longer :)</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Devi's place was inviting and they had a larger room available to me that was a pleasant surprise. We had a pleasant talk when I arrived after dinner. The location was excellent since my daughter lives five minutes away and Park Slope is such a wonderful neighborhood. Definitely recommend staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My experience at Devi's home in Park Slope was amazing. I absolutely loved Simone. She was very sweet. Devi's wife was extremely helpful with her assistance with calling a cab. I really appreciated the love and comfort in their home. It was peaceful and I am so in love with the Park Slope area of Brooklyn. Very convenient. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Small, cozy room with air conditioning (much appreciated in the summer!), in a nice home with lovely, welcoming hosts. Area is comfortable, safe and still lively. Lots of good places to eat. A few blocks away from subways. Good place and a good price! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Devi and his wife were both nice hosts. The room is kinda small but very cozy and just right for single traveller with everthing u need. Park Slope is one of the most good community in Brooklyn, very quiet and very safe. A few street of restaurants are very close, so is the Metro Station. What's more,  the dog Samon was very gentle and cute.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The neighbourhood is very safe and quiet. The house is very clean and close to subway. I stayed for a week and had a good time!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Devi's place in South Slope is in a good location for being in the Park Slope neighborhood and is walkable distance from downtown and upper Brooklyn subways and lovely walk thru Prospect Park to the Botanical Gardens and excellent Brooklyn Museum of Art. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Devi and his wife were my heroes last night!  I desperately needed a place to stay in NYC.  Hotels and Airbnb's were booked across all the burroughs.  Devi's room was an Instant Book.  Within 10 minutes, Devi communicated with me how to check in.  I stayed in the single room.  If you are a solo traveler just looking for a place to sleep and take a bath, Devi's room is a good choice.  The futon is comfortable.  The room and bathroom were clean.  The neighborhood is great with a lot of food and bar options.  It is easy to get into the city using the subways.  Devi and his wife were great hosts.  Thanks again for giving me a good place to lay my head.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I rented the small comfy cozy room with the couch and pull out desk. It's exactly as described in the picture. You get priority when taking showers area is a lot of health food stores around and Japanese stores too. The YMCA gives you three free guest passes if you get restless like I did and want to get a good work out in. My favorite part of my stay was there dog Simone.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>the photo shows only one wall of the room(good angle photo) , can't see in the picture that there isnt enough room to open the bad from a sofa mode nor the suitcase to be inside the room with you(not comfortable), the pipe of the house toilet and bathroom are going throuh the room so every time someone at the house will flush down the toilet you can hear that, the kitchen and bathroom of the house is in the upper floor wich you will nedd to climb on a squeaking wood stairs so every time someone will climb up or down the stairs you'r going to hear it( especially disterbing at night time), there isn't enough circulation of air in the room and when you open the A/C you'r brain is freezing because the room is so small that the A/C is pointed direction at you, the sheets dosn't smell very nice and there was a cover for the bad because it was stained so the sheets were on this febric that coverd the bad and becase of this the sheets kept going out from the bed and it was not comfertable nor hygienic.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Perfect place to crash next to the R train in between long days of work. Local food is excellent. Devi was an excellent host. Great communication and very accommodating.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Extremely quick and kind responses... I was scrambling to find a place the next day with a last minute work trip in the city and Devi was the most positive and easy to work with! As a NY resident the last three years, I had just let my lease go and put my stuff into storage to do some traveling out of the city... when the work trip happened, I just needed a place to sleep and meal prep for the week. While the room is VERY small (literally just enough to sleep and have one bag in)... it was quiet, safe, close to decent train service and the lovely prospect park. Devi and his wife are friendly, respectful, and easy to live with. Only downside was the creaky stairs up to the bathroom. I wake up a few times a night to use the bathroom and really hope I didn’t wake the other renter! Oh and their dog is a very big teddy bear! Intimating bark but such a softie and good protector. Overall great spot for someone who just needs a COZY place to rest :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Quiet neighborhood, very good location and easy going host</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Devi was very nice and understanding. His place was clean and generally as described. The cleaning fee is absurd(especially for a room that is 7x5 feet. And the price is not good as well.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Devi was very unfriendly to me and treated me as if I was a nuisance in the apartment. He did not offer a warm acknowledgement of my presence or even a \"\"good morning\"\" at any point during my 5 night stay. I was very taken aback by his behavior and still do not know what his problem was.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Jen was one of the best hosts I and my partner has had through Airbnb. The listing was in our favorite location in Brooklyn and it was a huge space, with amazing renovations and privacy! It didn't feel like we were sharing the space with anyone, that's how huge the apartment is. The room was very clean as was the whole place and Jen was available 24/7, answering any questions we had. She also provided us with a space heater when it got cold in the room. Definitely a MUST STAY if you are visiting Brooklyn !! Thanks again Jen.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My wife and I stayed at Jen's place for a month. This was our first time in NYC and also our first time using Airbnb. With Jen and her roommates' help both turned out to be a wonderful experience. We arrived late night (or was it morning already?) but we had no trouble getting into the apartment. The bedroom is exactly like described and the common areas also seemed to be recently furnished. Plenty of space for two people. We only needed to get used to the AC, which we are not exposed to at home (some drift, which could be shut down in the room and a little noise, which I guess is as soft as it gets). Jen/roommates/other guests provided us with lots of valuable tips and advice about what to do in NYC. We always felt safe in the neighborhood and the Myrtle Av subway station is a 3 minute walk, and M and J lines make it really convenient to travel to Manhattan. We have been also advised to eat out at several places in the neighborhood, and all of them were very good. So to wrap up, I definitely recommend Jen's place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good stay, good price, close to the subway.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The room was really good. The bed is comfortable and pillows are great (I need to buy the same ones in Belgium!). The situation is also nice, at 20 minutes from Manhattan. The neighborhood looks a bit weird the first time but finally it's really great and safe ! \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Really convenient place and I enjoyed the privacy of the room. Only thing was that the place smelt like weed a couple of nights when the other guests were smoking. Other than that, great location and amazing stay! :) </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Amaya was patient and helpful with us. The room is really good but the bed is a bit noisy. The subway is close (3 blocks from the house). Overall, really good experience in NY and in her house!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thanks for having us! I stayed for almost a month here. It's a tidy and clean apartment in a really great location. The area is super convenient and so close to the JMZ and Mr Kiwi. Amaya and Khalil are super nice with great communication and the cat is very cute. The only thing was that the apartment is much busier than I expected from the listing. The room I booked wasn't the room I stayed in - we were upstairs and close to the kitchen and upstairs living room. These were often quite busy - as at some points there were 9 people staying in the apartment. There are 2 air bnb rooms, and 4 people always live in the house across another 3 bedrooms. Not to nitpick....but the bed......was actually quite hard and super noisy. I had a good stay - but it was busier than I imagined from the listing, and it got pretty noisy on a couple of weekends :) :) :) which might be perfect if you want to meet some travelers and have lots of chats! Definitely I would recommend --- but maybe a bit busy for someone like me! Thank u!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a good time at Amayas place. Everything was easy, clean and we felt like home. In the area there are some nice bars and it's easy to get around.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything we experienced at Amaya's place was great! All areas were clean and comfortable. It was quiet. Close to good pizza and the subway. She gave us good directions to get to her place and she was very helpful in every regard. Highly recommended, if you need a place to stay in Brooklyn!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>good host! resolving any problems</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is the perfect flat for 2 people, it was in a great location surrounded by amazing restaurants and some great bar, a few monuments walk from the subway that connects you with everywhere that you could want to go. As for the flat it's self, it was packed with everything that you could need, from coffee to straighteners, blenders to cable TV, my girlfriend and I had a lovely stay and would defiantly stay again! P.S. Alice the host was great at replying when you had questions or quires.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Oh my goodness! Alice is absolutely wonderful and her place is equally as awesome! It is WONDERFUL for a NYC trip as it's so close to trains and public transit. The apartment is comfy, cozy, and everything in between. What she has done with her space is tremendous! She was super gracious in hosting and left us with great recommendations and travel information. She was super easy to reach via text and left everything we would ever need for a great time in NYC! Beautiful place, wonderful host, and a great great neighborhood with everything you could want for a trip to NYC! We will definitely be back if Alice would have us!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>For a first visit to NYC, I couldn't ask for better host: good information available and a clean place to stay in a peaceful quarter. This helped to make for a memorable first visit.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The apartment was lovely, with a really comfortable bed and fully equipped kitchen. Alice was an excellent host, very friendly and accommodating. It was close to the subway which is essential in New York.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Everything was excellent. Alice was very informative and the place was very clean and comfortable. Awesome stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Alice went way beyond any expectations I had of a caring and grateful host. Not only was she kind and communicative to the point of being the first to text me good luck on the marathon day, she was also super flexible with checking in and out. Her apartment was super clean and filled with organic, healthy food and drink. The bed was a proper comfy double bed and the bathroom was laid out with towels and amenities like a proper hotel. I can't recommend her enough. The apartment is a one floor walk up in the middle of UES with the 4,5,6 subway within 5-10 min walking distance. I had a brilliant time, much due to the fact that I could sleep comfortably and arrange my own breakfast, snacks and occasional dinner. I can't recommend her enough. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I loved staying at Alice's apartment in NY! Amazing location and very cute and clean! I never met Alice in person, but she was very good at communicating through text!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Alice's place was excellent.  She communicated quickly and also was very accommodating to our desire to check-in a little early.  The place is beautiful and the location was perfect.  We were in walking distance of The Met, the Museum of Natural History and Central Park.  There were so many awesome bars and restaurants nearby including a phenomenal scotch bar called Caledonia.  We will be staying with Alice again when we visit NYC next.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apartment was amazing! Very clean and neat. It has everything you could need and in a great neighborhood. Alice was very responsive and had a wonderful list of nearby restaurants and other activities for us to do. For my first AIRBNB, this was wonderful! I can't wait to stay at Alice's place again! Thanks!!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Alice was a super host.  We loved her apartment, which was supplied with everything we might need.  When we had some questions, she was very responsive and came to our aid quickly, which we appreciated.  She had lots of information about New York City which helped us a lot.  The apartment is small, as are most apartments in NYC, but very cozy and comfortable.  Great water pressure!  The bed was very comfortable with nice linens.  The location is excellent for tourists. It was great to  return to the apartment after a long day sightseeing. Pretty neighborhood.  Definitely a good place to stay!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Alice's place is great: conveniently placed in a very nice neighborhood, clean and confortable. Alice is an excellent host, very attentive to our needs. An experience I really reccomend.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Alice is a warm and welcoming host. The apartment is in a great location and is charming. The bed is comfortable and the linens and towels are hotel-quality. As an older couple, our only problem was carrying luggage up a long flight of stairs to the second floor. (No elevator) The living space is very tiny. This is probably not the best place to stay if you plan on hanging around in the apartment all day. But it's terrific for a good night's sleep.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Alice's apartment is an amazing space with so much character. If you're looking to truly experience Manhattan and other cities in New York, the location of the apartment is perfect, in the upper east side, just 3 blocks from the 4/5/6 subway and a 10 minute walk from Central Park. It was so easy to get around New York with this subway station so close by. Alice's place is very clean, well furnished, and perfect for 2-3 people. Communication is great and she left us with a binder filled with great sites to see around the city. I definitely recommend anyone to stay at Alice's!!  </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apartment is just as described! It is cozy, clean, and equipped with everything.  The location is perfect.  It is a quiet and safe neighborhood with lots of local hot spots.  There were bars, restaurants,  nail salons, coffee shops, and markets nearby.  The subway is walking distance from the apartment.  Central Park is super close as well.  Alice is an amazing host and very easy to communicate with.  I will definitely stay here again when I return to NY.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I did not meet Ashley personally, but check in and check out process were incredibly simple and accommodating. Apt is located in very accesible area, close to the subway. Ashley was also very fast in responding to any inquiry we had. Did not spend much time in the apartment, but overall we had a good experience. Thank you Ashley </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My stay was great! John´s apartment is an excellent choice if you are planning to go to NYC. He´s a great host,  a very cool dude and help me out in many ways.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>John was a excellent host. He showed us a lot of good spots to hang out and eat. Especially the ramen noodles around the corner was so delicious. The location is perfect. Right in the middle of Chinatown. It's a 5 minutes walk to Soho and Nolita. And there are a few subway stations nearby. John is a funny guy and very helpful. Everything was very clean. He had a nice bathroom and a comfy bed. We're so glad we met John, we hope to see him again. We recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"John has a cozy apartment in the heart of Chinatown. It is on the 5th floor over several cute shops where you can get some great food, gifts and other services such as massage and beauty. Most places in C-town require cash for payment, so make sure you have some on hand. As other reviewers have stated, it's convenient to several subway lines. There's also a nice park nearby which always has something going on. We were lucky and had pretty good weather and it was good to come \"\"home\"\" after long days being on concrete.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>john was a fantastic flat mate for the month I spent in nyc. he was barely home but when the occasion arose, it was a real treat. he was super friendly and would share treats and good conversation. his place was always tidy and he kept the espresso machine stocked at all times. the location is convenient to get anywhere in ny and I would highly recommend checking out the good and inexpensive noodle shops in the area. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Had a great time at John's place located in such a good area to get around. We even had a beer when I arrived, can't beat that!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great and kind hosts. Really good location. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Cozy room, awesome neighborhood and good company.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a really nice stay at John and Sylvia's apartment. The room was small but enough for two people. We only had a hanger to put our clothes at so we did not even bother to hang it all up since it was not enough room for the clothes. Sylvia was a great host and we had some good conversations, she was really friendly and helpful. On our arrival we had some trouble finding the pickup location for the keys so we had to walk for a while in an extreme heat to get it right. But after that it was all good. Sylvia had friends over a lot of nights but that did not bother us at all. When we first got to the apartment Sylvia had not changed the sheets but she had warned us about it and when we got home after being out she had taken care of it. The bed it self was okay but a bit hard. We would also have liked a little more space in the fridge since it was almost full all the time, we only had space for some bottles.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Although I have been a member for a couple of years this was my first time using Airbnb. I am so very pleased with my experience that now the bar has been set. I wish to have as nice an experience or better the next time. Nothing less. When I return to New York I will definitely hope that this apt will be available for my next stay...Lee was an excellent host. Our interaction was minimal. I am a Native NYer and didn't require a lot. But the time that we did spend with him was great! We had such great conversation with Lee that I only wish we had spent more time with him...The apt was just as the listing described. What I said when I first walked in was that it was just like the pictures. But actually seeing the photos in physical form was so much better. The apartment is clean and quite comfortable with a private entrance. Lee has the apt stocked with all your basic necessities. Oh and the towels are soooo (Website hidden by Airbnb) located in a very nice neighborhood with stores and the train station is not far at all. We would sometimes return late at night and felt safe walking back to the apt...We did very well with our first Airbnb experience. I believe you will have a good experience too with this apt. and host Lee. Thank you Lee for providing nice clean comfortable accomodations.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lee and Kumar were excellent hosts. They made our stay in Queens extremely comfortable. We arrived late at night, to find ample provisions for both dinner and breakfast the next morning, without having to make an early trip to the shops. Nothing was too much trouble. Lee provided us with the daily paper each morning, and the fresh flowers were very much appreciated. Any assistance we required was readily provided.Would highly recommend this  listing to anyone wishing to stay in this area of Queens. Thanks again Lee and Kumar</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My wife and I stayed at Lee and Kumar's apartment for 10 days this month. We found the place extremely comfortable and both Lee and Kumar were excellent hosts. They were very friendly and more than willing to help us with whatever we needed.  Lee even made a taxi reservation for us when we were to return to the airport. The neighborhood is tree lined and quiet. A major street several blocks away has everything a visitor might need. We like the place so much we will be returning for 10 days in October!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This place is amazing if you dont want to stay in the city this is the place for you. The area is quite and there is a lot of options for food and other stuff right down the street. The pictures accurately show what the apartment looks like. The patio area is my favorite is a nice place to sit and relax while having coffee or just to chit chat. Lee is an awesome host my flight got changed last min on me and he had no problem letting me stay a few extra hours while I waited for my flight. This was my first airbnb listing I stayed at and the bar is now set really high. If you are looking for a awesome affordable place in New York this is the place to be :) </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What a wonderful place and amazing hosts.  Lee and Kumar go above and beyond to make your stay perfect.  There is parking on the street if you have a car.  It is easy to walk to anything you need and a quick walk to the subway A train.  Great resteraunts in the area and many deliver.  The apartment is very comfortable and has more than one would expect.  The outdoor area is beautiful.  We hope to come back.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The apartment is beautiful, very clean, cozy and comfy! You have everything you want in a little place. Lee and Kumar are excellent hosts, they welcomed us on our arrival and gave us the perfect tips to make our stay the best. The neighbourhood is close enough to the city (50 mins by train). We really appreciated their kidness, they brought us champagne for New Years!! We would definitely love to stay there again. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lee & Kumar was amazing hosts.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Kumar and Lee are really great hosts, they made our stay amazing.  The place is really clean and it's in perfect location. Highly recommended .</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Kumar is an excellent host. Very hands-on, particularly during difficult times. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Just as described. Gracious hosts, clean, good amenities, amazing hot shower, convenient to subway and shops, and a great hotel alternative within walking distance to racetrack and casino.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>i stayed at lee and kumars for 8 days .. all went excellent .. i didnt get to meet them in person but their friend Ky checked me in, he was very friendly and helpful ...\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our second stay at Lee and Kumar's place was excellent. The apartment is located on a quiet residential block of well kept houses. The apartment is clean, comfortable and accessible. A great bed, soft towels and wonderful toiletries. Kumar and Lee were   always available for help and advice. We look forward to returning in the future.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Better, near subway, market, good neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lee & Kumar's was amazing I loved it, it was very clean and close to public transportation for traveling definitely wouldn't mind going back</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Staying at Kumar's place was a nice and different experience. Kumar is a klever guy and very friendly. At check-in he was there to show us the place and to explain the amenities of the apartment which was as described in airbnb. Towels and sheets were very clean. A good supermarket is located two block away.  Although the place is far from Manhattan (of course we know that during the reservation process) we could reach Brookling and lower Manhattan in 25 and 30 minutes using the  subway express line \"\"A\"\".</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was wonderful. The room,house, and the place....   everythings were good.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Highly recommend! There is truly not one thing I dislike about this flat. The guest house is located in a safe suburb community that’s monitored and quiet. Very close to trains that get you to Manhattan and other boroughs! The apartment is warm, comforting, vibrant and well spaced. The hosts provided all the things you could need so you don’t feel too far from home! Easy check in! Kumar was amazing to communicate with, always responding and accommodating. Defs one of my fav places I’ve stayed at here in NYC. Hidden gem in Queens!!!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I stayed here for a gateway weekend with my boyfriend and it was amazing. The train was very close by, the garden was stunning, and the home was so clean and had a lot of useful amenities. It was very homey and warm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Can not say enough good things about Lee's place and very convenient location for the train to get in and out of the city.  Lee's a super host and so helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at Robs place is like coming home. Not only are Rob and Lizzie( and their friend Maria:) some of the nicest people I've ever met, they are also the most generous. Rob helped me out with finding all the cool places to see live music in town ( which is the purpose of my trip) and even took me to a friends party and made me feel like part of the family! The area is great with many cultures represented and plenty of things to see and do . The subway is close and safe - I walked home by myself in the middle of the night several times and never felt unsafe. The bed is really comfortable and the room is huge! This place is so good that I'm coming back in a week or so for another few days! I would recommend definitely staying here , and cannot give them enough praise . We have sung, smiled, eaten and laughed together and it's been great. Thank you so much Rob for making me feel so welcome ! Xxx</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Rob's place is convenient to the city and not too far from JFK airport. Also, the host is very friendly, play amazing music and easy to communicate with. I will definitely stay here next time when I visit again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is well located and Rob was a good host, but I’d hoped it would be a little cleaner.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Rob is a good host. He was very accomodating and generous with sharing his apartment. The localtion is good with easy acces to the metro. The apartment wasn't very clean but if you're fine with that Rob's place is a really good base when visiting NY.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Stylish apartment, excellent location, very comfortable. Great value! Would return in a heartbeat. The bathroom features ceramic tiles by the artist owner, a delightful feature we enjoyed.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Michal’s studio is an oasis in hectic midtown. The studio is quiet and well appointed. Michal was incredibly hospitable and helpful. I would definitely stay here again! The location also can’t be beat — you are conveniently in Hell’s Kitchen (good restaurants and bars), close to Times Square (great transportation options), but on a quieter street.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is a great place to stay. Minutes away from some great restaurants. A couple of blocks away from the shows. The apartment is amazingly quiet being so close to so many things. Had everything we needed. Comfy bed. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Room was in a good location, bedroom a good size. We had no problems apart from a barking dog!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Michal was a great host. Greeted us on arrival and helped us settle in. The location is amazing and walking distance to so many places and in a prime location for most subway lines. Highly recommend staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good accommodations, very cozy, good kitchen with appliances, it has a flight of stairs to the apartament. Michal and Ariel are very receptive and supportive.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Genuinely want to recommend this apartment to others. The location is amazing and it is very quiet which is unbelievable given how close it is to Times Square. Everything we could have needed was in the apartment. We will use this apartment in the future if we are fortunate enough to be back.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The location and the host make this a good stay. Michal was very responsive to any questions or requests we had. She also went out of her way to give us tips on what to do, and held our luggage after check-out since we had a flight later in the afternoon. The apartment is only a 5 minute walk to the subway, and within walking distance to tons of typical popular spots in the city. It is relatively quiet; specially for being so close to times square. It was pretty cold when we stayed and were happy to see that the heater and hot water worked well.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The location is pretty good and the price is reasonable. Nice people to chat with. The decoration in rooms are beautiful. It only takes less than 10 minuets to walk to Time squad. Highly recommend !</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Michal was great. She welcomed us upon our arrival, showed us around the Airbnb and the local restaurants and grocery stores near by. Her location was excellent for everything we wanted to do. Will for sure come back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The flat is in a very good position, close to Times Square (10 minutes by walk) but at the same time in a quite street. It's a good space for 2 people or for a family with a small child. Great exeperience!!!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>If you are looking for a place in Midtown New York, this is the place to stay.  There are tons of places to visit that are walking distance (Time Square, Broadway Musicals, restaurants, etc.) and the subway stations are close by as well.  Mical is a wonderful host and super sweet.  She responds quickly to any questions you may have while you are staying there.  My husband and I couldn't of had a more amazing time in NY (first timers)!!!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I would very happily stay at Michal’s again. The location was great; close to everything in midtown and convenient access to the subway. The local recommendations were excellent and the fresh flowers made the suite even more inviting. Michal and her husband also went above and beyond when I needed some last minute concert tickets printed. They were very kind to hold my luggage so that I could spend the day exploring before my departure. I highly recommend staying at Michal’s.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Future travelers to Michals place can expect to receive excellent concierge services and to meet all their immediate needs.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre is a fine host: precise, liable and friendly. The apartment is literally amazing: spacious, well equipped (including kitchenware,local WIFI, TVs etc). The neighbourhood is interesting and multicultural. Good public traffic connentions by metro and bus.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre was fantastic. He is helpful and available, and his place was amazing. He was interesting to talk to as well.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andre is a really nice guy. He was a good host and answered all the questions we had.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Stayed in NY for 7 days and Andre is in great part responsible for the amazing time that I had, while providing me with a clean, comfortable, well equipped and somewhat accessible place to rest. The way he keeps the apartment and follows up with the guests is extremely professional, showing that he really cares about the condition of the unit and the comfort of his guests. I strongly recommend his place for anyone looking for an affordable place to stay in NY, away from the noise of Manhattan. The neighborhood is extremely well served of all the basic shopping one requires, super quiet at night when compared to other parts of the City and very safe to walk at all hours. The majority of the people are super friendly too.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre's amazing two bedroom apartment did not disappoint. It definitely was an amazing place to stay in to explore Brooklyn and NYC. Clean and comfortable, the apartment left us with want for nothing. So much room to move, and all the essentials one needed to really live a day-to-day life, if you so desired. Enough towels, basic toiletries and even extra bedding for those colder New York nights. It provided plenty of space to chill and relax, without being restricted to just the beds. There even was a computer with free internet for those last minute searching and booking needs - this really came in handy for us, and I'm sure it would benefit all other guests.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I booked the apartment for my friends, and they told me they had great time living in the amazing apartment. The host is nice and helpful. This is definitely a good choice if visiting Manhattan and Brooklyn. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was great, neighborhood was good. Very nice street. Andre was a good host as well. Took care of us on our trip to NYC. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andre is a great host and we had a good time there. He offers a clean well-lighted place just a few blocks from the train into Manhattan. While we spent most of our time in Manhattan, this apartment is in a neighborhood that is also interesting and has its own distinctive character. It's also quiet, so it was easy to get to sleep at night. Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I spent one week in Andre's appartment in Brooklyn and I really liked and enjoyed my stay there. The appartment was nice, spacious and clean and exactly as advertised. Andre was very nice and was very helpful with everything needed. I felt absolutely safe in the neighbourhood and there was also everything I needed close by. The good thing is also relative proximity to JFK as well as several transport options how to get to Manhattan quickly. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Andre's place by far was one of the best places I've been in excellent host everything described to the Tee Highly recommend to all</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>can,t really say Andre made us feel welcome as he didn,t make an appearance until we were actually getting into the cab to leave.the apartment was quite basic but was really clean and comfortable.situated in a good place but didn,t find the nearest subway and had to resort to riding in cabs.But this was not a prob as only there for two nights.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was very good, spacious and clean. Andre was a good host. He replied the all the questions quickly. I had a car and to get to the house was easy, and I could find parking easily.    </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was very good, clean, well situated (6 min walk to subway, 30 min to Manhattan) everything as described. Andre is a very willing host, when we needed an european plugs, I wrote him and next morning we had it in our apartment. Would definitely recommend to other guests!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andre's place is exactly as pictured. While it is a well kept vintage brownstone, it is also very clean and comfortable. I had no problem finding free parking directly in front for an SUV both nights. I did not have- nor did I really need much contact with Andre. Though he was available by text. Everything was in its place really.  There is a cat and I am allergic, and even though its in the listing, Andre was good sport about finding a place for the cat. Not a bad stay.  </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre was awesome. He was there to meet us when we arrived and even helped to carry our bags in. The place was amazing; just as advertised. The place was very clean and the neighborhood is in the best part of Brooklyn. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We spent 11 spectacular days in andre's place. It made our nyc vacation feel better. There was excellent comunication between andre and us since the beginning, and his lovely mom was also very great with us. I really and highly recommended andre's place, which is exactly as pictures, very cozy and like home. Thanks andre for everything.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is in a great location. Although I wouldn't walk the streets alone after dark in that neighbourhood. The subway is a five minute walk away. The apartment has everything you need, some more utensils would be good. The towels are super soft and the bed is firm. It's get hot but the air conditioners are too loud to keep on while you sleep. You have no choice than to be up when the sun comes up because the curtains are all see through. The neighbours above come home at 4am and you can hear the high heals as they walk above you. I didn't find Andre that helpful, I felt he didn't know the area very well. We arrived at 11pm and we were grateful he meet us that late to show us around. However, we arrived hungry and asked about food he said nothing was open. I asked about a grocery store I noticed in the cab half a block away. Andre said it had been closed down for years. I found it open the next day along with another store open 24 hours and a Chinese take away on the corner that closes at 11.30pm, all of which can be seen from the front door. I asked where the subway was and was shown on the map where it was, he offered no advice on what train to catch or where to shop for food. It's the number 3 train to Manhattan for those of you who go. He said he would come by to collect rubbish and refill the water cooler but we never saw him. I left rubbish outside not knowing what to do with it. Overall it is a great apartment in a good location out of the city but do your own research before you arrive. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a good place. Very spacious and clean, just in an incredibly sketchy neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Great place. Apartment is excellent and clean. The neighbourhood can seem to some to be a little intimidating at first but I really grew to love it and wish I'd done more locally. The local restaurant Basil is great and recommended but expensive. Always check your bill no matter where you go. The 3 train on Kingston avenue will take you everywhere in manhatton and get the metro card....its the best way to travel...don't be afraid of the (Website hidden by Airbnb) safe and cheap. Me, my wife, and 15 yr old came and stayed for a week. We travelled the neighbourhood and subway as late as past midnight no problem. I highly recommend Andre's apartment. If you arrive late make sure you know where to eat or eat before hand as we struggled first night and the takeaway delivery places did not understand a word I was saying when ordering pizza or Chinese.  None of these are negatives though, just advice to make your stay more enjoyable.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The apartment was clean, spacious and well furnished. I felt very comfortable in the apartment. Andre was an excellent host and easy to communicate with. I had no concerns or problems with the apartment. I enjoyed my stay and look forward to the next one! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre's place was amazing!!!! The home was just as described in the pictures! Very quiet and clean neighborhood! He was very nice to me! He answered every text and call, he even face timed me when I had difficulty with the key lol! I will stay there every visit to NY that I make! Don't pass this up it's amazing! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre's place is amazing and we felt very confortable and make us fell in home. His mother gave us all needed help! And I thank you very much for all and I really invite you to share his place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a really good time in the apartment. Located in a second floor, it is a lot bigger than it appears in pictures. It's quite comfy and warm, and has everything one might need: from toilet paper, towels and kleenex to salt and umbrellas. There's also a very cute cat that visits from time to time, and Grace is  a really attentive host.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre was an amazing host!  Great communication, anytime we needed him he would respond quickly.    We flew in early and had a late check out and he was accommodating to our requests.  The house was absolutely beautiful! A charm in the heart of Brooklyn!   Extremely spacious and clean. There was extra amenities throughout each part of the house.  Access was easy and secure. The neighbourhood is quiet yet you can find everything you need very close by.  Getting to the train station is easy as well.   Inside the house there is cable in each room with ample amount of channels to surf through.  Although, when in New York, who has time to watch tv?   We felt like Andre's home was our home and we loved staying there.  Anytime we visit again we would love to stay with him and I highly recommend anybody from singles, couples to family with kids to stay here as well.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great time! Really good location, beautiful place, can recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andre was an amazing host. He let us check in earlier and he was very nice and helpful whenever we needed something! The place is well connected to the city center and it’s a very nice and friendly neighborhood. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very Neat and Quiet place. There was absolutely no disturbance of any sort. All the amenities in the rooms are in good order and highly hygienic state. This place is highly recommended</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The Apartment was nice, big, and well-equiped. There was no mention that there would be a cat going back and forth in and out the apartment. Eventually it pooped in the livingroom so a bit cleaning was required. That was not something we liked so much but otherwise it was a good stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Conveniently located- very large space that was comfortable and extremely nice. Close to good spots to eat and to the subway. It is very clean and has lots of towels for guests.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This place is so beautiful! The awesome original wood detailing,  doors, and parquet floors are intact and lovely!! A very special place to stay for our daughter’s NYAA graduation. ( p.s. Oh, and the shower is updated and amazing!) Also we were lucky with street parking and the subway was convenient.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We loved staying at Andre’s place! Super stylish and very comfy. His place was sparkling clean and every room smelled amazing. It was a perfect location, easy to get to everything and he gave us lots of great tips of local restaurants. If you’re looking for a place in Brooklyn I would highly recommend staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed 5 nights with my mom and my almost 4 years old. Everything was very good... place was clean, Andre answered my questions right away and it was easy access to subway to Manhattan and JFK. I reccomend his place and also the Domenican Restaurant that is 2 blocks away... perfect hommy food for everyone, specially for those who have children. Oh, and Molly (cat) is adorable! My girl loved it!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a wonderful stay in Enid's flat. With two nearly identical sleeping rooms and a beautiful, big luminous living room with kitchen the apartment is perfect for 4 people. The apartment is also good located: supermarkets and two metro stations as well as the 125th street with many shops are just at a few minutes walk distance. I can really recommend this place for a New York stay and Enid is a lovely and helpful host. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I was a little hesitant to book an apartment in Harlem and booking it online without ever having used Airbnb before. Enid was very kind, responsive and helpful in the months leading up to our arrival and that helped soothe some of my uneasiness. When we (my myself, my husband, my 15 & 22 year old children) arrived at the apartment Enid was there waiting and was very kind, she gave us a brief rundown on the apartment, the area and had helpful information for us. She also said not to hesitate to contact her during our stay if we needed anything. The apartment was just as it looks on the photos, it was nice, clean and comfortable, had all the comforts of home and we really enjoyed it over our 4night stay.  It is in a good location near 2 subway stations and Harlem which is a really nice area with good restaraunts and grocery stores. I would highly recommend staying here and we will most definitely if we get to make it back to NY again. Thanks Enid!\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Enid. L'appartement était spacieux, confortable et très propre. Les lits sont confortables, il y a des serviettes et des débarbouillettes ainsi que tous les produits nécessaires à l'entretien. Nous avons apprécié les petites attentions comme le café le matin ainsi que le petit dossier préparé par Enid pour nous informer des services à proximité. Nous avons utilisé le métro chaque jour (soit à partir de la 116e ou de la 125e rue) et le trajet pour s'y rendre était en moins de 10 minutes pour chacun. À partir de ces stations, il est facile et rapide de se rendre aux diverses attractions de la ville en moins de 30 minutes la plupart du temps. Aussi, l'épicerie est tout près, ce qui était pratique pour les déjeuners. Finalement, nous avons aussi apprécié de pouvoir stationner notre voiture dans la rue, juste en face. Nous n'avons dû la déplacer qu'une seule fois durant notre séjour pour respecter les interdictions. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a great time there. All was as described and Enid was an excellent host. Apartment was great, location as well.  Public transport close by. We really enjoyed our time there! Highly recommended. Thanks Enid.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Enid's place is great. It's spacious, and has everything you might need for a short or extended stay. I stayed there with a colleague for a week, and had absolutely no complaints. It's also in a great location for the subway--catch the 6 to the east side or the 2/3 to the west side. And there are lots of good restaurants and bars in walking distance too. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed at Enids apartment from May 15 until June 18, first with my husband, then alone for 12 days and finally with my daughter and sister. The apartment was exactly like showed in the pictures.  I really felt at home, Enid always responded immediately when I had a question and was very helpful. She also recommended good restaurants or where to participate in a Sunday Gospel Service. Her house is located in a quiet street (except for the trains, but, after a few days, I didn’t hear them anymore) and in a safe neighbourhood, not far from subways and supermarkets. I surely recommend her apartment and, if coming back, would stay here again! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was our first air BNB experience and we really loved it. Enid's apartment was spacious enough for us 3, it was clean and also good located. She welcomed us after a very tiring flight, showed us around and she had a lot of information prepared. Overall a solid first air BNB experience in this beautiful city. thank you Enid! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great Host!!!, clean place, with everything needed and more, definitely would consider it again, just the distance from touristic places is considerable, but good place</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Enid is an amazing host, you can ask anything, anytime and she is always happy to help, This place is exactly as described and is very modern, a great place for families as both us and our to girls loved it...</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Enid was an excellent host! When we arrived, the place was clean and Enid was there to welcome us. Being a local, she has great recommendations for the neighborhood. She also has a super useful binder with lots of important information. The beds were comfortable, the neighborhood felt safe, and it was very nice to feel like we had a home during our trip (instead of a tiny hotel room).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Enid is a great host. Both checking in and out was really easy, especially since Enid lives close by. She had prepared a folder with useful information about the city, the neighborhood and where to go in case of emergency. This was very helpful and very appreciated. All in all we had a good stay here but there is one thing you should be aware of. New York is a very loud city and this apartment is next to the subway which is quite loud. This could be a problem if you're not a heavy sleeper or simply not used to live in a loud city.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Enjoyed my stay in this lovely big two bedroom apartment. The host is very well organized and offers lots of good tips and advice.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great stay at the appartment of Enid. She was very helpful during our arrival and gave us some good tips for using the public transport, stations to avoid, etc. The appartment was very clean and better than we thougt it would be. Our first use of airBNB was a great experience. The visit of New York City is intensive if you want to visit so many things in a short time, but we could relax at the place of Enid. The train was a bit noisy but they don't drive that often in the evening/night. And if you visit New York, you don't want to sleep late :-D</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great Harlem apartment. The living area is a good size and the kitchen was really well stocked. Terrific location near Latin quarter, subways and supermarkets with an easy walk to Central Park. Enid gave us a warm welcome and was really helpful in the lead up to our trip.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The department is great super large, has a spacious living and dining room, has all the needs, super cute and the hostess Enid is nice and friendly for any questions, I recommend it anyway, it is an excellent option</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing stay here. You are walking distance to Central Park and close enough to everything you need.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Enid is a very kind host, the communication and information was very good and helpful. We, a family with two (close to) grown up sons, had a very pleasant stay. It was great to have a cosy place to return to after long days in downtown  NY. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Enid is a very kind and good host.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thr apartment is very clean and convenient, the neighbourghood queit and feels safe. Elska is very friendly and a good host!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Staying at Elska's was wonderful! She was very responsive in communication and her parents were very helpful and pleasant. The place is just as described - very clean and organized. Has everything you need for a short stay in Brooklyn. It was an amazing experience!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Location, hospitality was excellent!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The place is great and the host is amazing!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was very good, clean, and with everything you can expect and even more. Very well located. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Staying at Rich's place was perfect for me and my parents. Rich is awesome and made it super easy. Backyard area is so nice, and location is excellent. Definitely that \"\"home away from home\"\" feeling that we could not have gotten from a hotel. Highly recommended!! \"</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a good stay at Rich's place.  He gave us a very warm welcome on arrival and made us feel right at home.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>A truly excellent property and host. Rich leaves no stone unturned to ensure his guests have an excellent experience. Moments away from a ferry port from which you can be transported to almost any part of the city and a whole host of local bars and restaurants. It would be difficult to find a better option in the Brooklyn area. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Rich's place is warm and inviting! Conveniently located next to the ferry, the subway, and in a delightful little neighborhood, we felt like locals in no time! The Barge on the River was a welcoming place for late night drinks and great ambiance, and the neighborhood itself was amazing! I loved Word, Home of the Brave, and Feng Sway. The Naked Dog also had great food and was open late. Despite being in a great neighborhood and close to transit, it was quiet. Quite a few hours were spent outside listening to songbirds and the hum of the city. Perfect with my son because it had the backyard and the outdoor patio, it was the perfect home base for our trip. Highly recommended, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. While we didn't meet Rich during our stay, he was prompt with answering questions and was one of the most gracious hosts I've ever had through the site. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Our stay was wonderful! The communication with Rich was stellar and the accommodations were amazing accommodations. Everything was as described, perfect and the process of Check in and check out was seamless. The neighborhood is great, hip, family friendly and both lively and quiet. There's a great park by the water and a bike/running path that travels along the east river. There are also many transportation options as well: train, ferry, bus, citibikes and cabs. We loved it so much we intended to stay there again when we return next year! Five stars all around!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Had a great time at Rich's place. Clean and comfortable in the amazing Greenpoint! Just a block from the waterfront which hosts gorgeous views of the city skyline and the apartment was spacious and well designed. Nice big back yard space (not that we really got to use it in December) and he was quick to respond with anything we needed. Thanks again Rich!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Rich's place is a home away from home. Located in Greenpoint, there is plenty of food places to check out too. Williamsburg is only a 20 minute walk away, alternatively you can take a bus, and there is plenty of shopping to be done there! The house was super comfortable and spacious. Rich also has a great collection of books and vinyls, which is great to wind down to after going out during the day. Rich is very good at responding to messages and a great host!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Beautiful house with very good vibes! We loved it. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We just had a very pleasant week at Rich’ apartment. It’s a nicely decorated place with a good feel and plenty of room. Conveniently located in a very nice part of Brooklyn. Lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance. We really liked  Friducha restaurant,  great Mexican food, nicely decorated and a very reasonable price. At the corner of Java street and Manhattan blvd.. Subway at less than 10 minutes walk. Manhattan in 20 minutes. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was really good. It was a really nice apartment and totally clean/tidy and nicely furnished. It was quite big too and there was plenty of space for five people to stay in. We were even provided with a selection of drinks in the fridge as well as a Keurig coffee machine with a variety of drinks to make. The street it was on was pretty quiet and a nice street. It was about a 15 minute walk to the subway stations which weren't too bad but one of them was the C line which is useful for going to central locations. Edmund was a good host and answered any questions that I had. I would definitely recommend this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had the most amazing time at Edmunds house. The apartment is a fantastic size and really clean. Edmund left us water and treats which was so wonderful. It's about a 15 minute walk to the station but it was good to have a morning walk. We would stay here again in a heart beat.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was the most perfect place for me and my family. We arrived late night and the place was warm and ready for us. Fresh flowers, cold soda/water and vine, and fruit. We spend 7 nights here at Edmund's and several times we where in contact with Edmund, sometimes because we needed information about the neighborhood other times because Edmund was checking up if everything was OK or if we needed anything - that is good service!\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apartment was amazing - just as spacious, lovely and clean as the pictures show!  All the furniture is really comfortable and the beds especially after a long day touring.  Edmund made us feel very welcomed with a thank you card, bottle of wine, fresh fruit, soda cans and bottled water in the fridge.  There was even a selection of coffee pods for the Keurig machine.  Plenty of towels and even toothbrushes and shampoo available in the bathroom in case they had been forgotten.  The kitchen had everything we needed - the only thing I would recommend would be a few more teaspoons and tablespoons.  We were more than comfortable in the apartment.  The street is lovely and the yards well kept.  Taxis into Manhattan cost $35 flat rate using Edmunds suggestion of a car service.  I would highly recommend staying here - Edmund was a most gracious host and always responded very quickly to any communication.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edmund was a great host, promptly responding to the booking and all subsequent requests.  The apartment was ideal, great size and nicely equipped.  The location was very good, a diverse neighborhood with ample parking if you are traveling by car.  I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone visiting New York City.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very  nice  place . I'll recomend  appartment  and  ofcourse  host . This  is  the  place  which  is  good  base  to  visit  Manhattan .</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I still can't believe how amazing Edmund's home was.  To find this size of an apartment in New York is almost impossible, so I felt so lucky the moment we walked in.  The pictures don't really do this home justice!\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our visit was awesome! The house was clean, well appointed and the amenities were excellent. The posting was accurate. Edmund responded almost immediately to any questions we had. This was an awesome visit.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Just returned to Ireland from an amazing trip to NYC with my family made even more special because of our base at Edmund's place . What a fantastic apartment , the pics and description does not come close to doing it any justice.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nous avons passé une excellente semaine à New York où nous logions dans l'appartement d'Edmond.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is great, what you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. It is located at reasonable distance from the subway so to get Manhattan is not a big issue. In my opinion it is a good choice to visit NY with children.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td> This a great unit which is well fixed, clean and well looked after.The space very comfortable and the kitchen, beds and bathroom are great.  The host is amazing at communication and provided us with spot on instructions. Parking is available in the neighborhood. If you are interested in touring down town NY city, you may drive in and metro transit is also available. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The flat and the host are great. The localisation is good. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a great stay at Edmund's place, the apartment looks as on the pictures and is very spacous. When we arrived we were happy to find a large number of cold soft drinks in the fridge and also some apples and sweets. The communication with Edmund was excellent and we didn't encounter any problems during our stay there.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edmund's AirBnB is such a gem! Such a good price, and perfect for our weekend in New York. Subway not far from the apartment, and easy to walk to places to eat in Brooklyn, and by car or subway in Williamsburg. We were in town for the marathon, and this space was great to come home and unwind in, after a long day! Edmund checked in a couple times during out stay, to make sure everything was okay. Which it was! Really appreciated his thoughtfulness and quick response time.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is spacious and looks just as advertised.

There was plenty of on street parking you just have to watch for street cleaning. If I ever return to Brooklyn I will stay at his place. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edmunds place is fantastic for a short or long stay in New York City. If you’re looking more for long term it would literally be perfect, especially if you have multiple travelers. The area is good, we never felt unsafe walking to or from the subway or just around. There are a few restaurants close by that take no more than a few minutes to get to walking. The subway is a 10-20 min walk depending on your pace and we made the walk at all hours (late at night) and one of our female travelers actually made it once on her own at dark with no problems. The space has everything you could need for a short or long stay, and we especially loved the shower. The TVs available in each bedroom were a fantastic touch especially for large groups. Very clean and Edmund had any amenities you could want. We really appreciated the bottle of wine after a very long travel day! Check in/out was a breeze and Edmund was very easily reached. I never waited more than a few minutes for a response to anything. Overall, a great space in a good location with a super host for a great price.  Thanks Edmund!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edmund's place is very welcoming, clean, cozy and spacious. The place is not far from the metro which is a good point. Edmund is very kind and well organized, and I recommend him with no hesitation. Thank you Edmund !</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Edmund was an amazing host! Super responsive and gave really good suggestions on places to visit. The location of his place was close to the subway and some really good restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Given how hot and humid it was in NY in the summer, this place was especially amazing because of the air conditioning.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edmund was a very good host, supporting us quickly and whenever needed. The apartment was spacious. Would have liked restaurants and cafes closer by.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had very good time with my Familly at Edmond house. Edmund have kind attentions for us.

My favorite being how nice he kept his bathroom. Overall I only stayed for a total of like 6 hours but my experience was good. Would recommend for short trips not for anything more than 48 hours.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The good: (1) very close to the subway station, with easy access to the comprehensive NYC public transportation system (no need to drive while in town); (2) house is also close to the downtown core of the Flatbush neighborhood in Brooklyn, with easy access to food and shopping (although most food places close at midnight); (3) host is very gracious and accessible, responding to requests within minutes; (4) safe neighborhood with a lively buzz during day and night; (5) parking is free (if you can find a spot).\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>C S's place is very clean and well-maintained. The rooms fit nine comfortably and ten with a bit of wiggle room left. The space is also on the opposite end of his living space so was very private.  C.S. was an excellent host and appropriately accommodating.  The complimentary french-pressed coffee was welcome during our early morning rise!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Not in a good neighborhood although very close to subway station \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This was an amazing stay. Very clean and a nice set up. Not far from the public transportation. Very culturally Distinct area. I enjoyed my time here and hope to catch this host again soon.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had a group of 10 people stay at C S air bnb and it was a wonderful experience. Firstly it is such an amazing location as it is a 5 minute walk to the Q train (Church  Ave Station) and bus stops. It was very easy to travel to and from the air bnb. It is also by numerous delis and stores. Inside, C S' place was very neat and clean. There are 2 rooms with a total of 5 beds altogether. I do want to point out that 3 of them are not matresses. 2 are Air matresses (Aerobeds) and one is a fouton so keep that in mind if you're looking for something specific. Other great amenities include a TV in each room, wifi, air conditioning, and supplies available to us (towels, soap, kitchen, et). 10/10 recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>C S’s apartment is nice and in a good location. Please be aware that he will be in the apartment with you (as me and my friends were not aware of this prior to check in).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Beth is a very nice and welcoming person. She and the other guys at Big Irvs gave me some good tips where to go. The neighborhood is great, not too hectic and plenty of nice places to go. Just ask around.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My time in Big irv's was great! Beth is awesome and very communicative. There was good vibe in the air and I definitely love them dog, gonna miss you Sam! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Beth's room was nice and clean. It had a lot of character with all the pictures and various designs on the wall. Some might find that off-putting but I did not mind. The other residents of Big Irv's were excellent hosts and Beth was very helpful about coordinating my check-in and check-out. The location is also fantastic with plenty to do in the vicinity. I would definitely recommend it for people visiting the area.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Clays appartment is really nice and was neat and tidy when I arrived. The pictures give a realistic impression. I went directly to the rooftop after I droped my luggage. The view is amazing! The flat is located 5-10 minutes from the Myrtle subway station which is a good connection to Williamsburg, Manhatten and JFK.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Clay's the most humble, relaxed and nice guy. Both to talk to and live with. And his apartment reflects that, with its nice interior and always a place where the eyes can rest on something interesting, a book about graffiti, an old camera or a vinyl record. I was here a week and had an excellent time. Would go again and recommend to my friends. The location is close to both the L (Wburg-Bedford) and M trains and there's many good places for food nearby. Bushwick's great like that. More about the room and apartment: always clean, everything working just as they should, excellent A/C, the gym is a very good element for people wanting to keep up with their routines while traveling, and the room and apartment is really well isolated so I am quite certain you won't find places a lot more quiet in NYC. If you're thinking of going: GO! You won't be disappointed, I assure you. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I consider myself fortunate to have booked with Clay.  His listing is absolutely amazing.  The room that I stayed in was meticulously decorated with whimsical art and other items.  The bathroom is clean.  And, the amenities in the building are so unique and top notch. Although I did not meet Clay during my short overnight, he was always kind and responsive to my messages.  I look forward to having the opportunity to stay there again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>After a bit of confusion with check-in, I had a very comfortable stay at Cliff's lovely apartment. I saw two of the rooms that he rents, and they are even better than the pictures.  He was quick to respond to my questions via text (after check-in, I only ran into him once more during my 4 night stay.)  Highly recommended if you're staying in Brooklyn, it's a fun neighborhood with lots of great eateries, bars and coffee shops, close to two train stations. Clay is a good host, and I hope to stay there again next time I visit my daughter, who lives nearby.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Clay was super easy-going and a great host. Always available for any questions via text. The room was perfect, spacious with awesome decoration. Such a cool building as well, and I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood walking alone at night. Close to some very cool bars and really good food! Overall, no complaints about my stay at all.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Clay was an amazing host, very helpful and attentive. The place is awesome, great decor, cozy and very good place to stay. I absolutely recommend to everyone.  : )</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had an amazing time in this apartment.

Perfect host and lovely apartment. Definitely coming back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Clay is a really nice person and a good host. I love Bushwick and recommend it to anyone who wants to get to know authentic Brooklyn. This building is super nice and modern. The bedroom itself is great: super spacious, with a really nice desk and fast WIFI. The kitchen is nice, too. Perfect for making coffee and breakfast, or a quick dinner.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My stay at Clays apartment was great. It became my home for the 4 weeks that I stayed there. The apartment itself is lovely and comfortable, very clean and well equipped if you want to use the kitchen to cook. The room is very bright and spacious with a huge closet and desk which is a bonus. The building is an amazing artistic creation, very modern and definitely edgy. The rooftop is great for views of Manhattan, I would recommend drinking a beer up there at sunset. The L and M trains are really close by, as well as multiple bodegas, organic grocers and coffee shops. The neighbourhood was so safe I never once felt uncomfortable walking around by myself, the community is friendly and welcoming. I can't rate my experience highly enough, Clay is such a warm charismatic person with a genuine heart, he made my first Brooklyn experience so positive. I was extremely sad to have left. Thanks for everything Clay, I will see you for beers soon!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our stay was short but good, the apartment complex is beautiful and modern. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Enjoyed my stay at Clay's place. Very cool building in Bushwick, equipped with gym and laundry room, close to the MJZ trains. Had a little problem at checkin when Clay was not home, other than that everything's been amazing. Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Stayed at this airbnb for the week while back in brooklyn - good for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Clay's place is a great place to stay in Brooklyn. Not only was the room cozy and warm, but Clay and his housemate were excellent hosts and made me feel welcome from the minute I arrived. Thanks again guys!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Such an amazing place. Loved the decor! Loved the delicious breakfast! Loved chatting with our host and other guests!\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is an amazing home about 2-3 blocks from the nearest subway.

Jessica even provided breakfast each morning that we stayed and gave great recommendations about dining and enjoying NYC</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Jessica is a wonderful host and the house is amazing. It was a special spot for a perfect trip!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a lovely stay at Julian's place.

Clean,  good communication with host,  most issues resolved promptly. Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Julian was an excellent host and very helpful. We had a great week staying at his apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The NYC airbnb market is rough. You don't know if you're going to end up in a place with thin walls, a fruit fly problem, or something worse! Julian's place was none of these! It's clean, in a nice building, in a GREAT location, and it's quiet! My GF and I couldn't have asked for anything better for our 4-night stay here... definitely hope to stay here during my future trips to Brooklyn. Also, Julian responded promptly - communication was good - and even let us check in super early after our redeye to NYC. Thanks, Julian!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Julians place was excellent. Exactly what I was looking for in a place to stay on a long work trip. Julian responded to every request right away and the place was quite and clean. Couldn’t ask for more.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I rented Lara's apartment for my in-laws and they had an amazing time! The apt is extremely clean, comfortable and perfectly located, and Lara made sure they had everything they needed. The building is great and there's not much to say about the area, which is one of the most appreciated neighborhood in NY; close to transportation and to Manhattan but also far enough from the chaos. Check-in and check-out went smoothly, Lara made sure everything was set up. I would definitely recommend this place, and I'm sure my in-laws will stay here again when they come back in NYC!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Modern and comfortable apartment on an amazing location, super close to the subway, 15 minutes away from Manhattan.

Enjoy all the best Williamsburg has to offer (like Smorgasburg literally across the street), from the comfort of a large apartment, save money by self-catering in the well-equipped kitchen. Lara is a welcoming and kind host, very accommodating, makes sure you got what you need, and ever only a text away.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lara's place is a very pleasant, stylish-modern apartment. My partner and I stayed there for a month on a professional assignment and were happy with our stay. The location is excellent, right by smorgasburg, the ferry dock, convenience stores close  by, delis, wine store and many other commodities, plus nice restaurants and bars around. Communication with Lara was good, she was helpful when we needed it.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Perfection is an understatement. Annette's place is  absolutely beautiful, comfortable, and accessible. Her apartment is in a very amiable neighborhood where people do say \"\"good morning\"\" with all sincerity. During my week-long stay I came across two grocery stores within walking distance of her apartment and hidden gems along the way. The apartment is a few blocks from City College of New York so if you are worried about walking around at night</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The house was lovely and the room very comfortable and a good size. Annette and her sister were excellent hosts. Loved having access to the kitchen and being able to fix my own meals, especially as I was travelling alone and didn't want to eat out in the evening in restaurants.

The house is clean and well decorated, people who love paintings might enjoy this place. Annette and her sister are very friendly and welcome to provide support. Another good thing is it's close to the subway station (around 5 blocks). We stayed here for 4 nights, sometimes can hear the neighborhood arguing and the sound of the street cars. But overall it's acceptable, we like this apartment and would recommend it for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My daughter (19) and I (54) had a very good time in Harlem NY last week (okt 2014).

Though we were out and about a lot we had nice chats with Annette and Arlene. The room in which we stayed was beautiful, as well as the rest of the house. The bed was very comfortable. Also the bathroom which we had to ourselves was beautiful, clean and very spacious. It was quiet during the night (we never really were at home during the day) and we never felt unsafe in this neighborhood. There are two metro stations (5 min walk) nearby and so you can easily get to Central Park, Downtown or whatever place you want to check out in this amazing City. Everything was beyond our expectations (way better than a hotel!!!) and we would highly recommend this place for a stay in New York.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Arlene, Annette's sister welcomed us to their stunning home. We met Annette, who was very friendly, on Day 2. House was spacious, tastefully decorated and close to subway station. We had a very comfortable room with excellent amenities.

We enjoyed the pretty room,  the good bed, the perfect bathroom and the relaxed atmosphere of Harlem. We would love to come back some day and strongly recommend this place to other airing users.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had such an amazing time in New York. The house is very clean and beautiful decorated. Both Annette and Arlene are very friendly and interested in talking. I had some issues with my luggage which didn't arrive at the airport and they really helped me out by talking to the local delivery service. The location of the house is also near to downtown as there is an express train near to their location. The neighborhood is save, cleand and all shops you may need are there.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Annette et sa soeur.

Nous avons partagé des très bons moments avec nos hôtes. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The bedroom was excellent, everything is like is shown at the pics!

The bed was comfortable with quality sheets and plenty of pillows! We certainly slept well. The jewel of their crown was the amazing bathroom though! So large and clean. It could be the biggest bathroom in Harlem! The towels were thick and fluffy and there were actually 2 showers! The only downside could be that it is on the 3rd floor. If you have heavy luggage or difficulty with stairs, this might not be the best choice for you.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Traveling to NYC is not always the easiest situation for me, but my stay at Annette's home was easy, comfortable, and restful. The room I stayed in was excellent - clean, comfortable, breezy, and quiet. I honestly cannot think of any way it could be improved. The bathroom was spacious, clean, and as if it came out of a magazine - 2 separate showers?! Fancy. And to top it all off, Annette was very warm, friendly, welcoming, and offered me water upon arrival.

She provided everything we needed, and having a private bathroom to ourselves was a plus. The location was great, close to transportation, and great places to eat. Our room was on the 3rd floor so there’s quite a few steps but you get passed it once you see how great the place is. The room had no tv but tv is provided in the living room and kitchen area. We will definitely be back, one of the best places I’ve seen on Airbnb.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great place to stay, everything was clean and good attention of the host. Very safe neighborhood, grocery store and subway station near the house.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Annette was absolutely amazing! It was difficult to find a place in NY for the Spring so I was a little hesitant to rent out a bedroom instead of an entire apartment. Regardless, the price was right and the stay was even better. Annette reached out to me days prior to my arrival and kept consistant communication throughout our stay. She was a great host and the room was clean and enough for my wife and I to stay. The location is a few blocks away from food and the subway and both my wife and I were very impressed and pleased. My wife fell in love with the house!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Pretty good experience, our room and bathroom was great, clean, private and very comfortable.

Annette was an excellent host and made us very welcome. She gave us tips on the best options for local transport and things to see. The house itself is beautifully decorated and cosy.

She is also a great host. I’d recommend her place to anyone visiting NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Annette has a lovely, comfortable home close to everything Harlem has to offer.

Georgia was very nice and helpful in every way! helped me with the subway and gave good advices. very flexible and so friendly. the place is beautiful, clean, and the neighborhood is full of bars and young people. very easy access to manhattan. beautiful experience and would definetly choose this place for the next new york visit !</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What an amazing stay! First of all, the communication all the way to NYC was great with Georgia, even more impressive, she was there to welcome me: she's wonderful! Her place was big, clean and the location couldn't be better: plenty of free streets parking, directly above the subway while being quiet enough for a good night sleep.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It all went really well, Georgia is an amazing host. I felt welcome and was all just like it says in the post. The apartment is literally besides the G/L Metropolitan/Lorimer subway station, and you can go from there to Manhattan in minutes. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Georgia is an amazing person! Such a great and friendly host, she made me feel so welcome! She's wonderful and provided me an incredible stay!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good location, good communication and easy check in and out. Thumps up i general.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>nice and cozy room everything was fine and subway was just around so it was really nice to go somewhere. but as subway is so close sometimes it was noisy and there wasn't enough soundproof facilities so i need to use earplug everynight. except this, everything was really good.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We enjoyed our stay in Georgia's apartment, which felt like having a studio because we barely saw Georgia.  Our few interactions with her were very friendly, and she went out of her way to ensure a smooth check-in even for a middle-of-the-night arrival after multiple plane delays. We found the apartment good value for the price and we loved the location right next to the subway and walking distance from everything Williamsburg has to offer.  The apartment is a 4th floor walk-up on a noisy, main thoroughfare, which could prove tough for people who don't like stairs or who are light sleepers, but we were fine with it.  We especially appreciated Georgia letting us bring our 6-month-old baby with us since it can be hard to find an Airbnb in NYC willing to take a chance on hosting an infant.  All in all, it was a comfortable room in the heart of Williamsburg with a friendly host and we'd stay there again without hesitation!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>A bit noisy because of the location-- but then, well, it's an excellent location. So no complaints, just compliments</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our stay at Georgia's appart wa perfect. Williamsburg is a great neighbourhood and Georgia's location is perfect for exploring both Manhattan and Brooklyn. Georgia is a great host, we felt really comfortable, like home! She gave us a lot of good tips and was very attentive. We recommend this place to all fellow travelers wanting to explore this beautiful city!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Georgia was such a wonderful host-- she made coffee for me each morning and made sure I was comfortable! The place was so cute and the location was amazing. I highly recommend!! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a great trip. Williamsburg is an absolutely hip part of NY with a lot of good restaurants, bars and shops.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Second time here, so I already knew what waiting me. An amazing space, in an amazing area with the amazing Georgia. Hope to come here soon again. Highly recommended :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Georgia’s appartement is very clean, the room is perfect for 1. It can be noisy at night but it didn’t prevent me for sleeping. The location is amazing, L train right down the building and the neighborhood is very safe. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Georgia’s place is an amazing value for the location - basically in Prime Williamsburg and 2 seconds (literally) from the subway! It’s a 4th floor walk up and her brother has graciously helped me carry my giant suitcase up the stairs.. a feat of its own. Because there is a separate entrance to Georgia’s room, a lot of the times it feels like a private apartment. She was also so sweet to leave little bathroom necessities (even hair-ties) for those of us who may have forgotten them, and I haven’t seen that in another Airbnb yet! Overall it was spotlessly clean, extremely convenient, and a charming stay with a lovely host! I highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good value in a good location</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Anoop is a fantastic host and the apartment is great in terms of cleanliness, amenities and the location (restaurants & subway). He knows the the area very well and had a lot of good suggestions on things to do, eat, travel etc. I would definitely recommend staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Sandra and Orlando are really nice and friendly people! They have helped us with every problem we had (for example fixing my skateboard) and gave us tips where to go in new york and what to do. We had a very good week in new york :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sandra and Orlando are amazing people! Really, it was our best airbnb experience. If you need anything, tips about where to go and where to eat or what to see for instance, Sandra and Orlando will help you for sure!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a phenomenal stay with Sandra and Orlando. The apartment is small, but clean and very cozy. Its about a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station, and all the essentials can also be found only a short walk away. As convenient and comfortable as the apartment was, it was the people that really set the experience apart. Both Sandra and Orlando are incredibly nice, happy, and interesting people. I immediately thought of them as good friends rather than simply hosts. During my month long stay we regularly had meals together, and would hang out and chat most evenings. I found myself having deep discussions and learning about everything from music, food, and local restaurants to foreign politics and the future of scientific development. I am planning on staying here again, and looking forward to spending more time with my new friends. The stay was exactly what I was looking for, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking to make new connections and experience a non-commercialized part of Brooklyn.  </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was amazing. I felt at home. Sandra and Orlando were the perfect hosts.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The best decision for NYC trip is that I booked Sandra&Orando's Airbnb. They are amazing, welcoming, fun people and easy to communicate. I stayed for 5 weeks in the house. We used to hang out, have dinner together and talk a lot for most of days with other roomates. They were very nice and helpful for everything that I needed in NYC.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This apartments should get 10+ stars just for hosts, great hosts, I felt like at home from the first days. I spend with them so much time, nice dinners, cool conversations.They are really helpful and will give you all the information how not to get lost and how to spend good time in this lovely city. Flat located close by 3 metro lines (8-10 min) so you can easily access all the part of NY you want, it located quite far from Mht it take time to get there, but it NY it always takes forever to get anywhere :) this city is anormous. Neighborhood looks tricky in the beginning, but I never had any problems, even then was coming back at late night. Shops and eating places is really close too. Generally, I had amazing experince with Sandra and Orlando! ;)  </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sandra and Orlando are amazing hosts. I was a little bit scared before my travel, because I never have been so far away, but they really helped me to feel at home in New York. They are really nice and funny and everyday I felt like I am part of their family. They told me about the best places to visit and how to get there. They have a lot of insider knowledge about New York and the American lifestyle and this really helps you to settle in the US. They are much more than just hosts to me, they are my friends now. And I thank them so much for making my trip to New York unforgatable. Their appartment is also nice and transport to Downtown Brooklyn or Manhattan is in walking distance. If you look for fun hosts and want to have a good experience in New York, I really recommend staying with Sandra and Orlando. They are the best.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Superbe Host! They went over and beyond for me! I was welcomed to a very clean house. I felt like I was at home. neighbourhood was safe enough for me to walk around with my camera at night They offered me refreshments and cooked amazing food for me! I have made friends for life and would 1000% come again. Amazing for a solo traveller would recommend to all my friends!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sandra&Orlando are two amazing, sincere and open real Newyorkers. They made us feel at home since the very beginning, shared with us some amazing tips about the city and created a friendship that is going to last. We found not only great hosts, but also great friends. 10+!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sandra and Orlando were amazing hosts, very friendly with a lovely and very homely apartment in a great neighborhood! They went that extra mile to make me feel at home, my second home.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sandra and Orlando are amazing hosts. They made me feel super comfortable and Sandra made an amazing dinner. I had a really fine time staying at their place, it suited my needs. Orlando and Sandra kept on checking that I was warm :)</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our stay with Ron was awesome. He was such a great host, an excellent ambassador for Brooklyn, and just an all round awesome fun guy. He was able to make lots of cool suggestions for things to do, and places to eat. The place is roomy and close to lots of train lines, the neighbourhood is friendly, right next to the Brooklyn Museum and the Botanical Gardens. There is lots of green space in the area, and affordable places to eat and drink nearby. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Ron's apartment was very clean and tidy, the bed was comfortable, and he was an excellent host who took a few minutes to chat with me and make me feel comfortable!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice, huge room with window AC, in a 4th floor walkup in an older building (but I suppose that's new York). Amazing location right next to prospect Park, grocery store is a few steps away as well as great food. Ron is a great guy and wants to make sure you have a good experience. Would recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great space. close to local train shops and local bar's. Ron very accommodating good tops in local area and beyond cheers Ron hope to see you again soon</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ron was a great host. He had very clear instructions for check-in and was flexible when I didn't know how many guests were going to be staying. He even let us leave our bags at the place after the official check out time. It made a huge difference.  The location is amazing! It is close to the subway, but we barely needed to leave the neighborhood. Close to bars/restaurants, Brooklyn museum and prospect park.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Ron is super nice host. the place is located near the station, the room is quite big than i imagined. The neighbor is also friendly too and they have really good restaurant up there. Ron told me the best pizza restaurant and it was so good. Also some information he gave sounds really good too. He has really good selection!  It was really helpful that his response is really quick, I was nothing to worry about. Thank you, Ron! I'm really appreciated for this staying!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This is a great place to stay. It was close to many affordable restaurants and transportation. Ron was really nice and went above and beyond to make sure we had a good stay. I wouls stay at Ron's again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Ron's place is clean and comfortable.  He is an excellent host who offered local suggestions and went out of his way to entertain our pup while we were out!  The neighborhood is safe, and close to subway stops for an easy commute into Manhattan.  Parking is tricky with restrictions for street sweeping on alternating days, but free street parking is a big plus if you can find a proper spot.  We were only there overnight, but we were comfortable and felt welcome in the space.  Thanks Ron!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This Brooklyn quiet street house is so beautiful that we had a very wonderful experience when we stay in NYC! The house is big, clean, and fully equipped. There are lots of rooms available and no extra fees after 4 guests, which is very good, not to mention that it's comfortable and adorable! . This house is also very well located and you just need to walk few minutes to take to subway to Manhattan. Hetty is very friendly and welcoming, and always keep in touch with us to see if we have any questions and needs. Highly recommend to stay when you travel to NYC!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was good </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>good </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Sally was pleasant and attentive to my needs to have the front lock fixed sending someone to look at the problem. The apartment was very clean and luminous. The location was excellent. I would have liked to have the kitchen stocked better to be able to make simple meals since that was the reason why I rented an apartment rather than going to a hotel. I asked for a frying pan and Sally brought it to me the next day. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place has a good location. It did not have wifi though. Also, the shower had a stream that was way too strong. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Sally's Appartment was ok. Very clean. Sally was easy to reach and was dispo bible for our questions. The Appartment is quite well situated. Close from metro and shop and bar/ restaurant in a quiet neighborhood. We had good time.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Michael and Kristine were excellent hosts who provided me with very accurate directions and a lot of advice on good restaurants, bars and shops in the area. The apartment is lovely with such a relaxed atmosphere and the location is great. Michael and Kristine were very attentive to all the queries I sent them during my stay and answered all my questions in a timely and efficient manner. I would definitely stay in their apartment again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a very good staying! In Pat's apt there is everything what you may need for. Besides it is located close to many objects such as metro station, port authority bus terminal, Central Park.   Apt is absolutely as described.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a great stay in New York! Patrick's place was clean, easy to get to, and a great location. I also thought the building was relatively quiet (for NYC). Everything was as described. This was my first say with airbnb and it was a good experience. I would book again if I come back to NYC- thank you Patrick!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Pat's place is absolutely amazing and central to pretty much everything you want to be near as a first timer! The room is exactly how its pictured and the apartment is welcoming with everything you need. The neighbourhood was great and friendly. As a female travelling on her own I felt super safe walking around late at night after a theatre show or just around in general and everyone is so lovely (despite the stereotype!) I absolutely loved it, Pat is a great communicator and is super responsive. I'm already planning my next trip back :) THANK YOU SO MUCH! xX</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very convinient location just two blocks from Broadway and main subway lines. The room has a confortable bed and enough space for big luggage. If you plan to stay very close to major Mahattan atracttions, this is a good choice. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My experience at Pat's apartment was good but there are some things I think you should be aware before deciding to stay there. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This a nice room for a couple and the flat is very clean and comfortable. It isn't a big room but overall it's a good value for money in this area. PJ wasn't at the place due to work but he explained very well as how to get there and his friend Steve was also very helpful on our arrival. It's situated in very good area, in which is also posible visit midtown manhattan and central park by walk, and have easy public transport to everywhere.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I stayed in Patrick´s house for a week. It was amazing. I was very happy to be there. Steve is a good person and made me feel as I was at home.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Patrick's apartment is in a great location. It is an easy walk to the subway, and it is only two flights up. The room we stayed in is in dire need of a new mattress (full-size, not queen as stated in the ad), new pillows, and new towels. There is no way to adjust the heat and the room was quite warm, but a fan is provided and you can open the window. The apartment was clean and Patrick was good at communicating and answering questions.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>PJ's apartment location was amazingly centralized for us to hit all of the Broadway shows we wanted to see, and to get around the city.  We took a short bus ride and then the subway from the airport, which landed us within a few short blocks of the apartment.  We did not have to use a taxi the entire trip which saved us a lot of money for going to shows and to experience the diversity of restaurants and clubs in the area.   Typical of many of the places in New York the room and bathroom are very small but sufficient, when all you will likely be doing while in the big city is grabbing a quick shower and sleeping anyway.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location- times's square is about 10-15 walk away. Lots of good food around. Apartment was small but clean and comfortable. Pj responded to js fairly quickly when the internet was down and toilet bowl was clogged. Got the issues resolved quite soon.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Host was great. The Location was amazing. No problems at all.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Pat was a great host, very friendly. Steven welcomed us on our arrival and was very helpful with check in. Great location and neighbourhood, close to everything and lots of good places for eating and drinking. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>PJ was a great host during our stay in the city. He made us feel very welcomed in his home, which was excellent and well kept. He was very sociable and recommended an excellent area to go to that was a bit off the beaten path for a more authentic experience. PJ's friend Steve was also very accommodating in meeting us for check-in when our bus arrived later than we expected. We also really appreciated being able to keep our things in the apartment after check-out but before we left the city.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Had an excellent stay at pjs place. The room and apartment was immaculate. Amazing location. Safe building. Lots of good food around. Thanks pj!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Although I arrived late time (about 10 pm) the place, Steve(PJ's friend) is very friendly and kind to me. The location was perfect to go anywhere what we wanted. Moreover there are lots of excellent place to eat around the place. The bedroom was good to stay, and bathroom  is clean to use. It was my first airbnb experience, It was so good to me and my friend. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I personally like New York neighborhoods and this location fit my bill perfectly. Most visitors do not realize NYC (The City) is not just Times Square. The neighborhoods, usually about four square blocks, are what I find most attractive. I was able to see two plays at 1/2 price. One Off-Broadway and one in the Theater District with plenty of time to buy my discount tickets, travel to Union Square, attend a street festival and return to Times Square for the second (First Run) play. Got excellent Rye Bread at Zaybar's the next morning and was out of The City by 1130.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The flat was excellent, just as described, the bedroom was very comfortable, location was very good, just some blocks from central park and time square just in the middle of a great neighborhood not that touristic and fare prices to eat. Steve (Pj´s friend) was very friendly and give us some good suggestions to eat in NY. Without doubt I will stay again. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>PJ's room was fantastic. The room was clean, in a great neighborhood, and the price was amazing. It was very easy to pick up the keys and check out at the end of my trip.  I would absolutely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Pj's apartment was adorable! He was out of town so his friend let us in. He met us by the apartment and was super accommodating even when we were late because of travelling mishaps. Towels were set out on the bed for us. Apartment was nice and clean. The neighborhood is awesome, right in Hell's Kitchen. My boyfriend and I went to restaurant ave which is right down the road and ate some amazing burgers. Close to the MoMa and central park.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice room to stay in new york. Near to good restaurants, pubs and everything that you need to know in nyc.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>In overall, It was a good experience. The room was clean and ready</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Pj's place was great. Near Times Square, MOMA... But just set back enough that his place seemed peaceful and quiet. I only stayed for one night to add some business meetings to my NYC trip, and the apartment/room was all I needed. Comfortable, central, clean, and a good piece! I will definitely stay here again if I have a similar reason to be in that area! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I had the chance for a second booking with Pj and I was very happy about that, since my experience the first time was excellent. Thanks Pj! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>PJ's friend Steve met me promptly and gave me an overview of apartment and area as PJ not available.  Loved the location as it was right in the heart of Hell's Kitchen and about 4 blocks from the hotel hosting the conference I was attending.  The living area is very comfortable with good Wi-fi, plenty of windows.  Living area attached to kitchen in open floor plan. Overall apartment was clean and neat.  Only issue (which was not an unusual one for apartments in NYC especially when temperatures fluctuate) was the heat.  The bedroom was very warm and with the door closed there was no ability to create cross ventilation.  Thankfully, I found a fan and was able to use that.  Feel lucky to have found this place</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Awesome place! Great location, super safe. Comfortable bed, all around excellent stay. Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This is a decent little spot that does the job if you're looking for somewhere fairly basic that is good value and close to the action in Manhattan. The apartment is clean and bed was comfortable. Steve was great when I arrived and was able to answer any questions I had. Perfect if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a busy day in NYC.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Steve was concise and straightforward with his explanation of the accommodating rules of the apartment which made it easy to settle in and understand fairly basic boundaries. The location is excellent, surrounded by a plethora of eclectic and delicious food options. Being a more reclusive person I felt very comfortable even with other people staying in the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Wonderful experience! The location is great (Hell's Kitchen) with a lot of exotic restaurant to explore in the neighbourhood. If you're visiting New York for the first time, this is a good place to stay too. Landmarks like Central Park, Time Square, Empire State Building are within walking distance. Commuting to Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens are easy too. The apartment is not very spacious as most Manhattan homes, but still very lovely. Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Everything was just perfect, the house was small but very cozy. The location is just amazing, really close to everything. I recommend it to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This place was incredibly affordable for such an amazing location. I had a quick trip and really was only there at night, but it was great and clean. Very happy. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I met the host just outside the place and he was very welcoming. He gave me the keys and showed me inside and told me about the common sense house rules and just a bit about the city itself. The listing accurate describes the place and is clean and comes with plenty of annemities. The neighbour hood is rather quiet compared to the rest of the city, but it rather close to the subway and Time Square and has plenty of good restaurants around it. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is a great apartment! Kitchen was well equipped, rooms were private and comfortable, and Steve (PJ's friend) was a great host throughout my stay. The location was great. Only complaint was we're right above a bar so the music was sometimes audible late into the night, but it didn't bother me! Close to a ton of amazing restaurants and shops and roommates were all interesting and fun people.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good apartment, convenient, clean.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This Airbnb was amazing! The location was perfect, only 15 mins walking to Time Square and transports, and the house was super cozy, cute, comfortable and clean! We haven't met Pj but his friend gave us the keys and showed us the apartment. Everything when smooth and we really enjoyed our time there! Absolutely worthy! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location, beautiful appartment, a bit of noise from the music bar is a problem</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We enjoyed the location and convenience - there are good places to eat in close proximity, and we were able to walk a lot of the tourist sites from here - Central park, Broadway / Times Square, Rockefeller. Also close to subway which came in handy too for transit and sightseeing. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The room is as described in the advertisement, very good location of the apartment, since you can walk to all points of the city and this close to metro stations. Good neighborhood with plenty of nightlife.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Pj's place was excellent value for money. The check in process was smooth and he was very accommodating as a host. The place is centrally located and gives easy accessibility to all of manhattan. Very clean and quiet. I ended up being the only person there.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Pj's place was great. Cost friendly, good AC, and great communication. Would come again!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great location! This place was so perfect for getting around everywhere in Manhattan! Very close to the subway allowing us ease in getting just about anywhere we wanted to and sooo much in walking distance. Including Time Square, Central Park, and tons of amazing restaurants. The room itself is quaint and comfortable; great if you just want a nice home base to rest and are mostly interested in the city. There are a couple flights of narrow stairs to go up, so keep that in mind. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to explore the city! (Especially if you love good food being just steps away, like we did!)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The location is amazing and really good value. The bed was comfortable and the use of kitchen facilities was great.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was everything fine and it worked out good.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Convenient location and excellent hospitality. I had a great stay!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location and everything was good. Only one thing which I did`t like is letter box keys.... If you stay for long time then you need access to letter box but unfortunately it was not available here.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My sister and I traveled to New York and decided to do the airbnb and chose to stay at Pj's place. It was our first time staying at an airbnb and was not sure about it. We met up with Steve and he made us feel very welcome. He talked to us on our way to the apt about the neighborhood and things to do in New York. The apt has 3 bedrooms and all 3 were rented out. Our bedroom looked exactly like the picture as was the living room and kitchen. We visited with the other roommates and had a good time. Steve told us we were able to use the kitchen and cook anytime and keep things in the fridge. Shared a bathroom with everyone with no problems. The neighborhood was nice and we felt very safe even at 1am-2am in the morning. It was about a 15 minute walk to Times Square. The whole stay was wonderful and I would definitely stay at Pj's in the future!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment location is outstanding for the price. Apartment common areas are clean. Steve is very welcoming. If you are going for a fast trip to NYC and want to be in a great location for a good price this place is great. Room is a good size and has a good closet.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The room looks as it is presented in the pictures, the location of the flat is excellent. You got all the needed help from the host or his representative, just need to ask :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>general good. But the toilet got clogged frequently.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I was in town by myself for a conference in Midtown, and this was a great spot for me. It was an easy, short walk to Midtown; tons of restaurants and whatnot were very close by, as well as several subway stops; and it was much more affordable than the hotels in the area. Steve, who was managing the Airbnb for PJ, was super helpful and available, even as flight delays made my arrival a bit of a mess. I would recommend for any solo traveler looking for a good, central location in Manhattan.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was exactly as described. It's nice and cozy and has all the things you need. The location is pretty good with a 10-15 min. walk to Franklin Ave subway. Erin was always clear in her communication and responded very quickly to any requests. I can really recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I have stayed at several places on Airbnb and I have to say this was by far the best. Matthew’s apartment is gorgeous, the street is really quiet, there are amazing bars and restaurants within easy walking distance, and the room itself was perfect. Matthew got in touch almost immediately after I submitted my request and answered several questions I had about the space. He also had great advice about how to get to his place from JFK and was there to meet me with keys and show me the apartment.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The room looks as good as it dose on the photos!\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My mum and I recently spent 10 nights at Matthew's home in Greenpoint. The experience was fantastic and given it was my mum's first airbnb experience she was very impressed! We loved having a private entrance to our room, our own bathroom, kitchen facilities, a garden to relax in and of course the location was very convenient! It was wonderful to escape the chaos of Manhattan each night by returning to Greenpoint which had a relaxed vibe. Only a short walk down the end of the street is a stunning view of the Manhattan skyline-I highly recommend viewing it at night, it is magical! We experienced Matthew as being very hospitable, open, easy going, friendly, and respectful. He went out of his way to ensure we had a great stay and we felt that he highly valued his guests and his role as a host. Matthew truly shares his space with his guests and the pictures are an honest reflection of the listed room- which is large and  very comfortable. Thank you for an amazing stay, we hope to return one day!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Matthew's place is very well located and offers everything that It's necessary for your trip. My experience was amazing. The room and the bathroom were clean and he let me and my boyfriend use the kitchen and all the others stuffs. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Matt was a great host; friendly and easily contactable.  The room was very neat and tidy with good cupboard space and plenty of room.  Greenpoint is an excellent location only a few train stops from Manhattan with plenty of restaurants, bars and nifty shops.  plenty of walks, parks and places of interest close by.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Even though Matt we didn't get to meet Matt in person because he was in a business trip, his friends took good care of us. We loved the charming and tidy place, the quiet neighbourhood and the fact that it was so easy to get anywhere in the city. Thank you.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice greeting by Matthew and good explanation of where things were. Even an offer of fresh eggs!  The place was clean and close to so many places in Greenpoint. Unfortunately, my sister and I had problems with our allergies ( NYC dust?) and the city lights. We had to leave early. Matthew was very gracious in handling this. He worked to be sure we were satisfied customers. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Communication with Matthew prior to our stay was very good. The location of the apartment is also excellent with everything Greenpoint has to offer within a 5 minute walk but with the added bonus of the road being extremely peaceful. The room itself is very large and had every amenity we could have wished for. Had the best food at Glasserie and River Styx.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mathew welcomed us in and made sure we had every thing that we needed. The room was very comfortable. The bed was good and the bathroom was modern and clean. All of the towels were nice and soft. We especially liked the quiet street at night. The shopping on Manhattan Ave was close and good. The subway is close. We rode over to New York and found that the commute was easy. We had a couple of great breakfasts close by. One at the Bakery on Freeman and one at Eagle Trading On my way! Franklin. We would recommend this apartment as a good find.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was my first experience using airbnb. And it was a really  great one. Matt described this room prefectly. It's a beautiful room. Lots of character. Clean, stocked with lots of little toiletries. He ran out to grab soap and got a variety at that. He left us filtered water. The closet had lots of room, lots linens, pillows and towels. The bathroom was super clean too. The bedroom was separated from the rest of this house by a beautiful hidden door. His partner offered lots of info on the neighborhood. (After a really long travel day, she made me tea, sounds silly but it really made me feel better about my day.) A lot of little things made our stay here a good one. I would recommend this place for a long weekend; located near great shopping, coffee shops, yummy places to eat. Great place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The accommodation was as described and shown on the pictures. Public transportation easy to reach.  Very friendly host, who also proved to be a good source of information and good advice. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Matt and Vicki were amazing hosts and made my boyfriend and I feel very welcome.  The room was exactly as pictured and was very private with its own bathroom and entrance from the hall.  Street parking was easy to find and it was very accessible to Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn.  They provided all the necessary essentials and even had an additional small heater when the temperature outside dipped into the negative degrees.  Great room/hosts.  Highly recommended! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great stay here! It was a clean, spacious room that looked just like the pictures in the ad. Both Matthew and his girlfriend Vicky were really friendly and helpful. We also got a lot of suggestions on good restaurants and bars both the neighborhood and on Manhattan (and also joined Matt and Vicky out a couple of times). I can really recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Matt and Vicky where nice and offered a clean, convenient and good stay. Greenpoint is a really great neighbourhood with good services and mobility options.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Matt was amazing and the location was fabulous. Matt gave great suggestions for food and drinks in the area. The room was fabulous, and was slightly separate from the rest of the apartment and had it's own door, so we could come and go as we pleased. Could not recommend this place more!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This is a great place and Matthew and Vicki are very excellent hosts! Highly recommended to anyone who looks for a place with private bathroom and reasonable prices! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed for six nights here. The positives were that the communication and check in with the host was very good and simple. The hosts were lovely and were there if we needed them but we had a full schedule and were out most of the day. The location was good as it was a few minutes walk to the subway and you could get to Manhattan in about 20 minutes or less. The neighbourhood was fine, it felt reasonably safe, and there's lots of shops, places to eat, laundrette etc, everything you might need was there. The room was a good size, plenty of storage. A wardrobe, chest of draws, the hair dryer was useful. Wifi was good and no issues with connection. Things you might want to know. Although this is a large room, the photos show it as being much lighter than it actually is. A few more lights here might be useful as would some black out curtains on the front windows to prevent the street light flooding. The room faces the the main road and although it's not an exceptionally busy through road there is still a high amount of noise that comes in (plus a car that goes up the road the wrong way at about 120mph at 3am every day!). Use of your own bathroom is great. However, be aware that to access this bathroom you will need to exit your room via the internal door (which is connected to the hallway leading to the open plan kitchen/dining area) and turn immediately left in to the bathroom. This means that if you're heading to/from the bathroom with just a towel round you then anyone in the kitchen/dining area will see you. We didn't have a huge issue with this at all but perhaps a French screen/room divider in the hallway would allow a little more privacy and comfort for some guests especially when hosts are entertaining/have visitors round plus it may assist in blocking out the kitchen lights which flooded into the bedroom. The greatest issue we had is that we barely slept for the six nights. This is because the room is located by the main entrance to the apartment block. The main entrance has two doors both of which are allowed to be slammed behind whoever comes and goes from the apartment block. The door frames were right by our heads on the other side. The block has three floors with two apartments on each floor (excluding the basement section). This means that with six apartments housing about 12 people (estimated) that those two doors got slammed a hell of a lot throughout the night. Practically every hour from 11pm through to 6am those doors were slamming away waking us up leading to a complete lack of sleep for our duration in New York. The other residents were either unaware that people sleep during the night and closing the doors quietly had never occurred to them or they just didn't care....</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fabulous location, fabulous hosts, fabulous room. The list goes on. Just fabulous. Extremely good value for money.  Highly recommend. Can't wait to return. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location, appartement as expected and clean.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Matt's place was exactly as described.  Matt met us upon arrival to hand off keys and tell us about his amazing neighbourhood.  The apartment was perfectly located for our trip, Lots of nice shops nearby. We had long and busy days around town but coming back to the comfy bed, TV and sandwiches from the nearby 24hr deli was the perfect way to unwind.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Matt and Vicky's place is in a really nice neighborhood with lots of good shops. It is close to the metro and a 25 min ride to midtown Manhattan. They don't have a microwave but pretty much everything else you would need in a kitchen. Your private bathroom is right outside your bedroom door and you have your own entrance into your bedroom from the outer hallway. Now if you are sensitive to smoke you may consider not coming to NYC in the first place, that being said this apartment is no respite from the smoke. No one smokes in the house but this is a converted brickstone with thin walls and I don't know what for ventilation so you will occasionally catch a woft of the smell if smoke. Also this apartment is right at the entrance to the building, so, after the few steps in the entryway, it is nice and quick to get in and out with luggage. The flip side to that is that you hear everyone that comes in and out of the building so if you are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs. If you are sensitive to light when you sleep bring a mask. The guest suite has this lovely window out into the side walk but the curtains, as pictured, are translucent. Also the beautiful authentic sliding door to the hallway and kitchen has a large smokey class pane in it that lets in light from the common area, while still allowing for privacy. All in all a nice place to stay with helpful hosts.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>great location. had a bit of trouble getting in on the first day due to a stuck door but Matt responded very quickly and got us in within a couple minutes. I've seen some previous commets about the bathroom : it is private in the sense of not being shared but it is not an ensuite. had a good stay!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great place, awesome host, and amazingly comfortable bed.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Anthony's place was clean and close to the train. Overall, a good night's rest for a overnight visit.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>good place to stay. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Anthony was a great host, the bedroom is a good size and very comfortable, and the bathroom had everything we needed in it! I wouldn't hesitate to come back and stay here if I visit NYC again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Anthony was nice and super responsive. He was always prompt with his communication. We also want to thank you for accepting pets! Our 2 night stay was nice. We loved the building, because it was very historical and charming. I especially adored the vintage elevator. Location was pretty good, super close to lots of stores and restaurants. However, parking was a nightmare. We had to pay $50 for 2 nights inside a parking garage 4 blocks away. The room and bathroom were super clean but the toilet was running continuously and we weren’t able to flush normally during our stay, and that was kind of inconvenient. Also, it states breakfast was provided but nothing was offered. There was also no tea or coffee, which would’ve been nice. I wasn’t sure if we should’ve asked or what but it’s all good. Also, there was no storage in the room to hang clothes. The only closet that was there was filled with clothes. Overall, this was a decent stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place is good. Really close to the subway. The room is small and doesn't have AC . I've been in better places for that price but I guess it's ok for NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a good place! And Anthony is really kind.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Anthony is a wonderful host, he advised us good places to go downtown and his apartment is really well located (on the subway 1 going downtown in 20min).\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at Gloria's was really great, the room is nice and the house is very comfy with a homey feel. The kitchen is easy to cook in if that's what you want to do. The house is an easy walk to the subway and close to a grocery store. Overall a very good experience!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A good place to stay in NYC. Gloria is very nice and everyone else in the house was respectful and understanding. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I would recommend this place to anyone. Gloria is very friendly and makes sure u have a good time. I could definitely stay here again. Nice and quiet area. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I highly recomend Gloria's House. It was a wonderfull experience. Nice room, nice bed, cleaned house and good roomates. Gloria is very helpful, kind and friendly. The neighborhood is calm, peacefull and safe. My original plan was stay in her house for 3 weeks, but I extended one more. I truly recomend for travellers!       </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Gloria was a most excellent host! She checked in with me a few days before my arrival to make sure I had the directions and such. Her place is spacious and I especially loved the big desk in the bedroom to work on. There's also plenty of space at the dining table and it's an easy walk to the A and C train which connects JFK airport to Manhattan. Would stay agin!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a really good time at Gloria's house. The neighborhood is nice and quite close to Bushwik, Williamsburg and Greenpoint. It's also really easy to reach Manhattan. The house is clean and all the people I meet were friendly. You can put food on the fridge, use towel and cook. Never had problem. Gloria is a great host, helpfull if you need. And the dog is cute. Look forward to coming back !</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I stayed with Gloria for 2 months and it definitely was a great time. The house is clean and you are able to use the kitchen as well as the living room and feel home!  If you stay for a longer term, there are many laundry places to wash clothes and also supermarkets just 1 block away. You will need a max. of 10 minutes to walk to the closest subway Station and the ride to Manhattan takes about 30 minutes. If you are in New York for vacation, this place is definitely a inexpensive choice and also a great Chance to experience Brooklyn. The neighborhood Bedstay used to have a bad record, but it has changed a lot and you will be safe! It is a gentrifying area that contains a lot of nice little Brunch places and cafes. The architecture is amazing and the People you meet on the streets are nice and friendly.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was very easy to check in and Gloria was really nice when I met her. The room and bathroom were very clean. She accidently overbooked the room but then she was very quick in finding a way to accomodate and compensate me for the inconvenience. This place is amazing for its price. I would definitely recommend staying here :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Gloria was a great host! She is the heart of Brooklyn. Her dog, Rascal, is the sweetest dog around. I loved the shared room. The bed was comfortable. I sent a lot time visiting my uncle and friends so I didn't get to talk to her a lot and I met someone special too The check in process was amazing. I took a red eye from Seattle and she helped me bring my luggage to my room. I will definitely will stay there again, this Halloween, if I get the time off. I cannot tell you how awesome her home is! Thank you, Gloria.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I wholeheartedly recommend Gloria's home. It is lovely decorated, clean, in a great location (close to a few delis and cafes, and to multiple subway lines), it is nice and quiet, the value for money s more than I could ever expect, especially for NYC, the host is amazing, very friendly and easy to communicate with! \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We were welcomed by Lemont who was a wonderful host. The house was spotless and very comfortable. It was like being at home away from home. Great location, but most of all - excellent value for money for a stay in NYC. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>An amazing location for the price, and the host(s) are always able to be reached, day or night, very accommodating.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I was lucky to have stayed in this room in Brooklyn. I really felt like home spending my time at Gloria's house. The house has enough space, it's clean and I had everything I needed there. I enjoyed it very much and I'm very satisfied about my stay. Gloria and Lemont are very good hosts as well as very supportive people. Plus the dog Rascal is very cute!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Darwin and Nicole are amazing! I had a great time staying with them, they made me feel at home.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Space was large & exactly as pictured. I especially appreciated the full sized kitchen table for dining/laptop desk & the excellent kitchenette with a full stove/oven and many cups, bowls and plates. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nicole and Darwin are great hosts. They left me totally comfy and they helped me in all questions I had. They were always ready to help me. The apartment is as described, clean and cozy, perfect for one or two people. In addition to being very close to the subway. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet with good neighborhood. I have no complaints. I can only thank them for the stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nicole and Darwin are really friendly. We got some good tips from Nicole about what to have a look at and where to eat. Big hits for us were the tennament museum and the soul food in Harlem (a must try!), both were easily accessable by the subway lines. Really close to nice neighborhood bars too!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This apartment is nice and cosy. The pictures are accurate and we felt it was good value for the price we paid. We didn't utilise the kitchen much but everything was on hand; oven, fridge/freezer, cutlery, plates, cups and glasses. Location is great. It's close to the necessary amenities; you had the subway and Walgreens a couple of blocks away down one end of the street, and dairy/corner shops and clean laundromat around the corner at the other end. Neighbours were friendly folk who called out greetings to us as they played board games on their front step. There were even kids selling lemonade up the street. Some noisy people came out of the woodwork over the weekend but that wasn't unexpected and it didn't bother us. We didn't get to meet our hosts but they kept in contact and touched base with us during our stay to make sure we were OK. All in all we had a good stay at Darwin and Nicole's place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place is well located, even tho the neighborhood is not the best (police and drunk people were running out during the night). The communication with them was very poor and I had to solve by myself some issues like bad odors that made my staying there unpleasant for a couple of days. The thing that I really didn’t like was their unprofessional way to communicate to me: the day before checking in, Nicole called me to tell me they are going to sell the apt and that there were people going during my staying to take pictures to the apt. Of course I couldn’t find anything else the day before my check in, and I’m pretty sure they knew about the pictures and selling their house weeks before: they wanted to make some money without considering their hosts! My feedback is 2 stars (on 5). The only good thing is the J train close to the apt, that gets you downtown Manhattan in about 20 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This place is fantastic and I highly recommend it.  The apartment is super comfortable and tidy and the neighborhood is fantastic!  Marianne is an excellent communicator and always replied quickly to my questions!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Room and flat were very nice. Location excellent.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>SJ was an extremely gracious host who made us feel incredibly welcome. She showed us how to get around the city immediately, and was quick to meet any of our needs. The room is actually bigger than it looks in photos, and very spacious! The area itself is amazing; I would happily have stayed around there instead of going into the centre of the city, just because the food, people and nightlife were so exciting! Really loved Brooklyn, and loved our host! Thanks Sj :).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We loved our first trip to NYC! The apartment is kept extremely clean, the rooms are big and spacious- bigger than expected for a local apartment :). The portable air con machine in the room was good, it cooled the room down really quickly which is always a bonus! Although we barely bumped into Sue as we were busy seeing the sights, when we did see her she was very kind and polite and was always willing to answer our questions. The only points to mention are that the apartment is located next to a quite busy road and the windows don’t seem to block out the noise- however we didn’t really mind this and it didn’t disturb us too much, also we felt that the blinds were quite see through so we were quite conscious when changing with the light on in the evening! (These are just minor points that didn’t affect our stay). The location of the apartment is handy In that it is located literally 2 mins walk from the president st tube stop- from here you can get into manhattan really easily! We found the tubes were very regularly and always great getting into Manhattan however we would recommend leaving more time to get back from manhattan as often the tubes would change their stops and you would have to get off unexpectedly and wait for another. The tube only takes around 30 mins into mid manhattan which we thought was excellent! We found Crown Heights to be an ok location, we liked the part near the park and recommend Toms for breakfast (around 20 mins walk). Thanks so much sue for sharing your stylish space with us!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sue is an amazing host. The space was sparkly clean and we had a wonderful stay. The area is a little loud, but otherwise the stay was excellent!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>From the moment we walked through the door, Maggie made us feel at home. She gave us a tour of the apartment and showed us the lovely balcony and lounge area and our room. The room was great, the bed was really comfy! There's a kitchen in case you want to cook food but there's also lots of places to eat in the area. She gave us lots of good recommendations and advice about the city and in general made our visit very enjoyable! Thanks Maggie!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Maggie is amazing, a real New Yorker she will give you the uptmost love and respect that is needed, she will help you no matter what the problem, she is truly amazing 10/10 5 stars stay. Totally book. Like a second mother</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Migdalia place was amazing!! I had all the privacy. It was like being home all the time. The room comes with all the essentials that are needed, I was so grateful. By far the best Airbnb!!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The room is amazing. Maggie made us feel at home the moment we got there. The view was amazing and the bed was so comfy. I'll definitely be booking again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>its literally amazing, had a great time. Thank you Vida:)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sally and her place were both great! Much bigger than the pictures and such an amazing location. Everything was clean when we arrived and suited our needs perfectly. Would definitely come back again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lovely apartment with exposed brick work and wooden beams. In great location just beside central park. Loads of good bars and restuarants nearby and two subways within a few minutes walk. Sally very helpful and friendly. The apartment has everything you need - it is pretty basic but comfortable and there is a good shower and wifi. It is also very quiet. Can definately recommend - we were 3 and was perfect - might be a bit tight with 4 people + though as only one proper bedroom. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Overall, we had a positive experience at this apartment -- the place itself was beautiful, clean, larger than the photos suggest, good value for the price, and totally comfortable for the 5 of us (plus dog) staying there. Key pick-up was easy. The location was ideal - near central park, subway, buses, etc, and very quiet at night. There's a nice little grocery just around the corner for meals at home, and the kitchen was decently equipped. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This apartment was perfect. Plenty of room and two large beds. The major pluses are the excellent location right in the midst of the wonderful Upper West Side, very near museums, Lincoln Center, Central Park and subways; and how incredibly quiet the apartment was. There was some construction going on at the entrance to the building next door, but you could hear a pin drop in the apartment it was so quiet. The air conditioning was excellent (we even had to turn it down a bit, it worked so well). We did not have any issues, so did not need to contact Sally other than for picking up the keys, which was easy. However, it is a fourth floor walk-up, so would not be accessible for someone who cannot climb stairs. Also, as noted before, the cable TV is limited to broadcast channels, but otherwise worked fine.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment could be great, the location is FANTASTIC. Sadly, poor maintenance on A/C during the hot summer months, terrible housekeeping upon arrival, no intercom in a WALKUP and crock roach visitors in the night .... I could never in good faith recommend this apartment. Most important, a non-responsive host is never acceptable.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This space is absolutely amazing! Absolutely positively amazing. I has it all, charm, character, space, and plenty of room! Hardwood floors, full bath and kitchen, plenty of natural light, fully stocked kitchen, and an AC that worked overtime!\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Janet's place is a charm. We ended up there during the West Indies Day festival (not on purpose) and there was so much diversity and community. Her place is near everything you will need during your trip. Grocery stores, department stores, restaurants and transportation. Janet communicated well and also recommended some amazing spots that we checked out. I would highly recommend her place. It is not big but it is roomy enough for 2 people. She allowed us to use some of her food and even gave me a gift on arrival. I would stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Although I never met Sofia (transactions were handled by her roommate), the accommodations were excellent. Clean, spacious, and in good location. I highly recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Me and my partner stayed with Walther and Josh for a week in October. The apartment is beautifuly decorated, the shower is amazing and the bed was soo comfy! Really good location, easy to get to the centre of NY in a nice quiter location. Josh and Walther were really easy to talk to and were helpful and accommodating. I'd recommend their apartment to anyone, we really enjoyed our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Walther and Joshua were the perfect hosts, their apartment was lovely and in a fantastic location for getting into Manhattan (local and express trains from Court Sq on the M and E lines and the 7 went directly to Grand Central) The room was perfect for us, a lovely comfy bed and a nice little sofa. During our stay it was 30 degrees + and they went out of their way to give us a little air conditioning unit and a tall tower fan which really helped get a good nights sleep in the heat. Bathroom was clean and a nice powerful shower, never had any issues with waiting for the bathroom and sharing the space so it was a perfect stay for us! Walther and Joshua are so lovely and welcoming, two lovely people I a lovely apartment! Great communication, we always got speedy replies when messaging them. We would 100% recommend staying with them to anyone visiting the city! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Walther and Josh were very kind and helpful, from the beginning (answering pressing questions while we were still in The Netherlands), right to the end where we could leave our luggage in their living room while enjoying the last day before we had to leave in the evening. The around-the-corner line E is an amazing connection in combination with the Air train from and to JFK (in an hour you'll be at Walther and Josh's). At the end of the street of this Airbnb we found (only because Walther told us about it) an amazing industrial spot to drink a late night drink at the water with a fantastic view on Manhattan. Also the bar with singing waiters and waitresses on Broadway turned out to be a fantastic and hilarious place for dinner! The hosts weren't home a lot, but so could be said of us, and we felt at home and at ease the minute we arrived. So: thanks guys for letting us into your home and for making our stay unforgettable! We would definitely stay here again if we were given the chance. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The appartment is beautiful and decorated with great taste. It's near the metro and commodities. Walther is very easy to live and gave us good advices about the life in NY. I would love to go again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It is a good, nice and warm place to stay. I went there with my friends. Just one quick thing is the apartment doesn't have elevators so if you have large suitcases just be careful. Due to the time constraint, my friends don't have enough time to stay with the Walther and cause some concerns during the nights because my friends come back home late. For sure there are some misunderstandings. Walther honestly told me this is not a great customer experience and I feel very sorry about this as well. But I can see Walther's warmth and I wish my friends can spend more time with them. In general, if you are visiting NYC, Walther's home is a great place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had Amazing stay with a great host . Simone was very helpful and accommodating from the start. She showed me all the good neighborhood spots. The neighbors are friendly and the block is quiet . The apartment is right around the corner from the 1 train. Super comfy bed in a sparkling clean place. Highly Recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Simone was an amazing host. Always available when needed, prompt response from her when text. Her location is in a great area, easy access to public transportation. You will be pleased</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Simone is a fantastic host and her place is fantastic. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood with all you can need steps away. Inside it’s cozy and welcoming. Simone made sure we had good time and made us feel very welcomed. I definitely recommend anyone staying at Simone’s.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We loved Simone’s apartment. She was also an incredible host who took real good care of us. We enjoyed our stay and we’ve made an amazing friend from New York. Looking forward to seeing her again real soon!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Really lovely stay at Simonie's loft in Tribeca.   She has an amazing place in the heart of downtown.  Very close to work for me in the financial district.  It was a cold few days so didn't get to enjoy the balcony, but always felt great walking into her place after a long cold day.  Would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This tiny apartment is perfectly located for a stay in NYC. There are lots of places to eat nearby, and the subway is just a couple of blocks away. The building is old, but impeccably clean. Carlos is very helpful and replies to any texts immediately. This place is a good value.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed at Francesca's for 5 nights and can not say enough good things about my experience.  I strongly recommend her as a host,and the apartment was just what I hoped for.  Francesca made me feel very welcome - she left me toiletries, breakfast treats, a blooming hyacinth plant that perfumed the room.  The apartment was lovely - clean, airy, and in a very nice, safe-feeling building.  The location is great - just down the street from the magnificent Cathedral of St John the Divine and its beautiful park, just a few blocks walk to Columbia, surrounded by lots of restaurant choices, right near the subway, 24 hour drugstores, etc.  All in all, a great experience.  I give her place my strongest positive recommendation</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Francesca was excellent.  I did have to cancel my reservation, unfortunately, for personal reasons, and she was more than accommodating through that process.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Kristen was an excellent host!  It was easy to arrange check-in and check-out times with her.  Her apartment was comfortable and attractive.  It has a full kitchen and a large bath.  The queen-sized bed was comfortable.  She even left a bottle of wine and coffee/creamer for us!  \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Kristen has a lovely apartment - it's roomy and very comfortable - and the best location! It's like having a hide-away in the city - no street noise, incredibly quiet, and yet right there in the heart of the west village, one block from Washington Square. Kristen was a delight to meet and she took very good care of us and met us coming and going without any issues. I highly recommend her apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Kristen was a phenomenal host and my best airbnb experience to date. She responded quickly to communication. Her mother met and showed us the apartment. The apartment was better than the pictures, extremely comfortable, uncluttered, with a TV and leather couch in the living room, queen size bed in the bedroom, a clean kitchen with good appliances, and a bathroom with ample towels, toilet papers, and unused soap. The shower starts by pulling down on the bathtub faucet piece, water needs to run for a minute but when the heat is up it's good to go. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Kristen was a lovely host, very attentive and accommodating. The apartment is enormous compared to what I was expecting just from the pictures, and very quiet even though it's in a really exciting part of town. It's very conveniently situated next to good subway lines, shops and restaurants. The bed was really comfortable, which is always a plus.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Kristen is a wonderful host. She is very helpful and very easy to talk to. Her apartment is fantastic and quite large for the area. Perfect location! We had an amazing time and would definitely stay at her apartment again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at Kristen apartment was a very good decission. We had a great time. The apartment was perfect and the neighborhood was very good! The apartment has the perfect size. We enjoyed very much</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>What a terrific spot to stay in NYC..right on the corner of west 4th and sixth avenue with my favourite little street ( cornelia st) directly across west 4 th.. Has at least five great places to eat and drink just in that little street..Palma , home  cornelia st cafe, pearl oyster bar, le gigot...Kristin was a very helpful host with a list of her favourite places to help out her guests..happy to help out in any way and arrival and late departure were easy ..the apartment was a good size for NYC with full kitchen and decent size living and bedroom.. Lots of room for excessive amounts of shopping bags!\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was amazing staying at Kristen's place! \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My parents were visiting NYC for a week and had an absolutely amazing stay at Kristen's place. The location is great and very accessible to the subway and tons of restaurants  are nearby, not to mention just a few blocks from Washington Square Park. Kristen was very accommodating and flexible in terms of time in/out, and the place was very homey. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Kristen made us feel most welcome. When we contacted her on arrival she arrived promptly to let us in to her apartment. The area was excellent. Greenwich is a great part of town and handy to everything. There were about four bars and restaurants within a fifty metre radius of her location with loads more within easy walking distance. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This apartment has a great location and room to breathe. There is very little street noise (it really took someone laying on the horn to hear it at all). The apartment was clean and had a good kitchen. It was on the second floor, which was also very convenient. The host was kind enough to provide us with several recommendations in the neighborhood, which was very helpful. I would stay here again and recommend it. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Kristen was an excellent host, she was extremely friendly and accommodating with check-in and check-out.  My husband and I were staying for my brother's wedding.  The location could not have been more perfect.  Kristen was very flexible with our schedule, which was very appreciated since we were there for the wedding.  The neighborhood is exactly where you want to be! \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Kristen was an excellent host. She communicated with us honestly when it appeared some weeks prior to our arrival that her apartment may not be available due to unforeseen circumstances - luckily this turned out not to be the case! Despite not being in town when we arrived, she had arranged an easy checkin at a time that suited us, as well as providing an enormous wealth of information on the best places to eat/drink and nearby amenities and attractions. The apartment was of a great size for the two of us, spacious and clean, and in a fantastic location, surrounded by restaurants and banks, and a 20-second walk to West 4th Street Station for the subway. It is perfectly situated to get anywhere on Manhattan, as well as to the outlying boroughs. We would thoroughly recommend Kristen's home to anyone travelling to the Big Apple.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What an amazing location! So central, so close to the action of the Village, and yet so remarkably quiet too.

I thought it might be crowded, but I was always able to use it when I wanted.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apt is quiet, clean with lots of natural light. Good location on a quiet street.

The bedroom is very clean, private and quiet. For two people the room is a little cramped, especially with luggage. Overall good value but slightly off the beaten path with nearest subway station a 15 minute walk. Reka was very nice to let us drop luggage off very early before check in.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thanks for being a great host! I loved this place.

It was nice to come home to at night. Nicole was here when we checked in and she was easy to talk to and helpful. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Georgias place has caracter. When you go in the house you have feeling you entered in antique shop. Everything is old but it is that kind of style. After few days you get used to it. Anyway we didn' come to New York to spend time in the house. Beds are ok. We didn't have problem sleeping (specialy after spending all day outside and walking 15 miles per day). Only one bathroom in the house was little inconvenient because it was 5 of us but good scheduling solve that problem. Place was clean. We had two days of heavy rain so windows around AC were leaking. AC itself worked good (two of them in the bedrooms each, and one in the dinning room cooling place quick and good. It was very hot few days specially at night). Place itself is in the good position to subway (5 min walking, 25 min subway ride to Empire State Building), little convinient shops for food and drinks are around, few nice restaurants in the area, walking distance (25 min) to Brooklin bridge and DUMBO area. Georgia was quick to response to our texts and coresponding was ok (our flight was canceled and we arrive day later, so we were texting about that, and we texted about our leaving time and how to lock house and leave the keys). It would be little more convinient if house had few more towels (7 total for 5 of us for 9 days) so that we didn't have to use washing mashine (smal one. You can wash two big towels at the time). All at all it was ok experience for us.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Andrea had a real nice apartment in a vibrant neighbourhood with some small and good restaurants.

We were a family of 5 (2 plus 3 young children) and stayed for three weeks. So as for the good stuff- first of all great location. Awesome neighborhood both close to park, playgrounds, and restaurants and groceries.  Bus very close and subway  to too far. The way the house is devided  is very cool lots of room upstairs to play hang eat and cook, and the bedrooms are big. Sharon was very responsive  we had a few issues while there and she helped us fix and take care of everything. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had an excellent stay at Sharon's place. The house is well kept, equipped and situated. Nice welcome touch with some essentials in the fridge and fresh flowers. Also Sharon was quick to answer or questions.

It was great to have a large laundry room onsite and the rooftop deck is amazing. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Andrew's place was fantastic - clean, comfortable, spacious, and conveniently located. My husband and I stayed here for over a month and had no issues at all. Andrew was an amazing host - very responsive and courteous. The building is close to public transportation, has lots of eating options nearby, and my favorite - South Street Seaport. Thanks, Andrew!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a wonderful time in Andrea's lovely flat. The location was excellent, near all major metro lines to the city, bars, restaurants, the park and grocery. The flat was spacious with plenty of room for us to relax after a day out. It was also cool on a hot day. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Without a doubt Rachels home is the perfect place to stay in NY! It's an amazing, supercosy and beautiful historic place in the heart of Brooklyn with everything you need in walking distance. Apart from this fact Rachel is a wonderful and lovely host who makes you feel like home immediately, offers help whenever needed (even on her own birthday) and gives you privacy as much as possible. I really don't know what could have made it better. PS: you should also book and try a session at Rachels Massage Studio Williamsburg! You won't regret it.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had an amazing stay! The apartment is beautiful. A nice and very clean space. The place is located in a great neighborhood that has plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars around. If you are ready for an adventure you can catch a subway that is literally two steps away.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very pleasant stay in Sausan's apartment. Steve even got some toothbrushes and paste, as one of our suitcases arrived a day late. Great restaurant guide list, we tried several of the suggestions,  all very good. The apartment was very nice, clean and cosy, it has a very welcoming athmosphere.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Tiny clean space for a good night's sleep.  Starbucks on the corner.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apt. of Sausan is just as you can see in the photos. It's very small (althought kind of big for Manhattan) but very cozy and has all the necessary for an amazing stay. The lower east side is a great place to be in New York, with many restaurants and shops to browse all day long. Steve (Sausan's partner) welcomed us with  fresh flowers and fruit and provided us a great restaurant guide that has many great places we'd never had been otherwise. The building seems unkept in the exterior, but believe me that the apt it's a gem.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Very nice apartment. Clean and cosy. Sausan replied on my request right away and we were introduced to the apartment by her partner Steve, who was sweet and helpful. We received good info for \"\"first timers\"\" in NY regarding safety</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We felt so cozy and good in this space.   It was very clean and fresh as any nice hotel.  Personal decor touches and the lovely people kept the experience feeling alive and human, so nothing like the sterility of a hotel in that way.   Loved the neighborhood!  Eat soba at Cocoron just down the street.   Amazing!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Sausan's LES sanctuary was perfect! She was away, but her partner, Steve, welcomed us to the apartment. The apartment was clean and very neat. They even had a binder filled with restaurant recommendations and Steve sent to us to the best pizza place walking distance from the apt - Williamsburg Pizza. I would definitely stay again in the future as the location was pretty good - lots of great eating and bars around and not too far off from a nearby subway.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Susan and Steve were excellent hosts. This apartment is exactly as listed, so gorgeous, clean and in a great location. We felt very welcome and looked after with fresh flowers and lamps lit as we walked in to this little santuary off the muggy new york streets. We would love to stay here again - can't reccmomend it enough! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a fantastic week in New York staying in Sausan's flat. It is beautifully presented, very clean and had everything we needed. It is well positioned for a lot of good restaurants, Dirt Candy, Sauce and the Stanton Social being our favourites. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"We stayed 10 days in the apt and it was a very good experience . The neighborhood is really warm and sympathic. Description is accurate however the Building entrance needs to be a bit more \"\"welcoming\"\". Anyway</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Amazing experience, Sausan and Steve are great hostess, helping to us every second (even saturday 5 am), the apartment is just as described. They leave us some fresh fruit before we arrive. Very recommendable for turist. The neighborgh is very nice with a lot of restaurants, bars, deli stores, liquor stores, an amazing market. Also Katz Delicattesen is very close (best pastrammi sandwich ever). Thanks for all Sausan and Steve</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>After many long days of travel it was great to have a good hot shower and comfortable welcoming bed. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location in our favorite part of New York.  Very clean apartment just steps away from so many great restaurants and shops.  Susan made it easy for us to check in and out.  It is a hard bed.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but good to know depending on your preferences.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Steve was very welcoming when we arrived and gave us the low down on the local area and the best places to eat. The apartment was lovely and in an excellent location</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Sausans place was amazing, perfect for our visit. Would definitely stay there again. Very cozy, perfect location, has everything you need. Highly recommended!   </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Sausan and Steve were great hosts for our short stay in NYC. Checking in was smooth and Steve was very helpful and interesting to speak with. The location provides a good base for exploring NYC, especially the Lower East side area and even Brooklyn just across the Williamsburg bridge. I personally liked that there were quite a few cool cafes/restaurants to check out within walking distance. The studio is also an easy walk to a few different subway lines and station for exploring further parts of NYC. The area felt very safe. We will definitely consider staying here again when we return. Thanks Steve and Sausan! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What a wonderful time we had! The location of the apartment was brilliant, right across the road was Starbucks for a quick coffee and then amazing access to all forms of transport to discover the city. The apartment was clean and comfortable, everything we needed after a big day of shopping and exploring. I would most certainly stay here again, Steve was great! Thanks again!!!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>(Website hidden by Airbnb) the least I say about this place.    We absolutely loved our stay here.   Its in an ideal location on the LES with GREAT restaurants/bars all very close.  A short walk to Bowery and just a little further to the amazing shopping in SOHO.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Clean, comfortable and convenient, this unit is exactly as pictures. Hosts are wonderfully helpful and instantly responsive. Very well furnished and the wifi is very strong. Good location, a quick walk to the subway, with good restaurant options nearby. And the hosts give excellent recommendations. We agreed this is the best of the AirBnB rentals we've used in NYC. Would absolutely recommend and we hope to stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We found the apartment ideal for our trip, cozy and simple located in an amazing area. We walked a lot around Manhattan and loved the contrast from the way too hectic Times Square with the Lower East Side. Aside from the need to see the obvious touristy places (this was our first trip to Nyc) we would have happily stayed around the lower east side. So many places to eat and drink.  As much as we wanted to eat out, we had a few nights in watching Netflix and ordering take-out with which there were endless options, although Williamsburg Pizza popped up a lot! Never had the pleasure to meet Sausan who was away at the time but her partner Steve was great in getting things sorted. Would stay again and recommend</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was just what we were after for our 5 day stay in NYC. It's in a great location for exploring Lower Manhattan - and we felt like we got a real sense of what it's like to live in the Lower East Side. The bed was nice and firm (which is what we like). Steve was helpful and the apartment guidebook had lots of good suggestions about places to eat nearby. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This neighborhood is great. The room itself is excellent. Communication was outstanding. I was late in arriving but no problem. One of my best airBnb experiences</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Myself & my wife spent a week in Sausan's place recently. It had been 15 years since we were last in NY when we were teens so we had vague memories of the place but we had an amazing time. The apt is located in an excellent spot in the Lower East Side where you have loads of superb restaurants, bars and shops on your doorstep and easy access to the subway. You can easily walk to Bleecker St for great shopping and Williamsburg bridge is a 10 minute walk and a great day out! Sausan was not around when we arrived but Steve was super helpful with everything and called us on our arrival to greet us. The apt was exactly what we were looking for and made us feel like locals in the city. I would highly recommend Sausan's place for an NY visit and we would definitely come back! Thanks Steve!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Really nice place to stay. Apartment is cosy and clean. Location in the Lower East Side is perfect with central subway stations nearby - really is the best area to stay in Manhattan. Soho is just around the corner. Great restaurants and coffee nearby!! Communication channels with the hosts were excellent and were always happy to answer questions promptly. Our flight on the way over was very delayed - hosts were excellently accomodating and helpful, Steve met us at the apartment at 2am in the morning!!  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a good stay at Sausan's place. There is plenty of space in the studio for 2 people to exist nicely together for a few days. The kitchen and bathroom could do with an update and there were a few issues with noise - people going in and out of the building at night and the very noisy radiator. But the location couldn't be better. And the local bars and restaurants are the best in NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Affordable and clean room in a really great neighborhood !  Central to so many good places to eat etc </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My boyfriend and I had a quick weekend trip to NYC and Susan and Steve's apartment was just perfect. It was so conveniently located to all the amazing things that NY has to offer. They were so responsive and accommodating of our travel needs. The apartment has everything you need and you get a wonderful taste of experiencing a real neighborhood in NY. I would definitely come back! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>All great. As advertised, friendly host, good location.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Such an amazing NYC experience - Steve greeted us and let us into the apartment and the place had such great vibes. An intimate apartment with all you need for a week in NYC - would for sure go back anytime.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Very clean and comfortable, and an excellent location!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Host was amazing and very accommodating. Communication was super easy and positive and the stay was amazing. This location can't be beat, it's super easy to get around town and there's everything you could need within a 2 block radius. We were very close to nightlife and very happy with our stay! We will be staying again when we come back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location, lots of places with in walking distance, close to the subway. Would recommend it. Very clean, lot’s of good recommendations in the book.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a really good stay in this small but cozy lower east side apartment. Perfect for 1-2 persons and fantastic location in a really nice and happening area in NYC. Steve and Sausan was great and friendly hosts who responded quick and helped me out whenever I needed assistance. The place was clean and nicely decorated and the wifi was really fast. I was there during the colder months so the radiator was a bit noisy at times but other than that the building was very quiet. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Had a great time in this apartment! It was very clean with everything you would expect, including a kitchen suitable for cooking meals. It has a big smart tv with Netflix. It has a good AC unit which cools the room down quickly.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Its a very well located place, nice decoration and facilities, complete with tools and required elements that you might need, the negative things, noise as it is lower east side, extremely noise, no curtains, very light, windows not isolated, and noise from the fridge, the heating and the toilet, if you are ok with some noises and lights, you will be amazing on this appartment, if you have need silence and dark, you will have a bit of troubel adapting</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Sadly our trip was not a good experience. The apartment was very noisy and the bed was rock hard. We slept on the pull out instead. Not that great either. There is a toilet in the hallway and the neighbours use it all night sometimes with the door open. We didn't get any sleep. Steve did offer to replace the mattress after a few emails but by that time we were desperate for sleep. We decided to move to a hotel. Steve offered us a refund of $1800 of our $3200 back which was appreciated. We spent the final 10 nights in a hotel. I have never had to give a negative review but we were so upset that the apartment was not as described. I hope they did replace the mattress. I would also recommend cleaning the apartment thoroughly and replacing the mouldy shower curtain.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>JP is a wonderful host! Had a great time staying here. So many good restaurants within a few blocks. Museum of the Moving Image right there and Starbucks on the corner. Perfect location, great people, and wonderful apartment. Hope I can stay here again next time I am in the city!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Jp is amazing - was available by text at any time!

He exemplifies hospitality, warmth and friendliness. He was extremely accommodating and did everything he could to make my husband and I feel comfortable. The room is clean, and a good size with everything we needed. The neighborhood is very convenient and safe, with lots of late night restaurants and shops and really close to the subway. One really sweet benefit was sitting and drinking a cup of JP's nice strong coffee in the morning in his large living room. I looked out the window onto a lovely Japanese Maple tree  drenched in sunlight. It helped me start a very long work day off right!!! I am a New Yorker and it was a really easy commute back to the city. I highly recommend staying there; as it is a good alternative to NYC digs.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The appartement has a good location, you can get to Manhattan in 15-20 minutes and there are some nice restaurants around.

The neighborhood was great and close to the subway to Manhattan. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We didn't get to meet Joao as he was away when we stayed, but the organisation was excellent and his friend took great care of us. The Flat was fantastic, extremely clean and organised. We would stay there again in a second. Hopefully next time we can meet Joao.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The host was really nice and really accommodating, the location is excellent and the finish of the apartment was really good as well. One of the nicest Airbnb's i've stayed at and on any future trips to NY I would definitely consider staying here again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This place in NY is brilliant.  To be fair the pictures do not do this place justice.  The room is massive and very nicely laid out.   JP was amazing and was on top of everything.   We truely felt welcome and at home.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The communication with Joao was good and he gave us a very good describtion about how to get to the appartment. The location is good and it takes only around 15 minutes to the Rockefeller Center. The room was really nice with enough space for two people.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Joao is an excellent host! Can't say enough good things about him, his place, the service he provided to us. (Guys, the bedsheets smelled like a garden of heavens!!:)) Thank you for amazing airbnb experience. We absolutely enjoyed.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our stay was excellent! The room was very clean and comfortable, exactly as described. The apartment was awesome and Joao and his roommate were very welcoming. Their dog Blue was so cute and friendly! The neighborhood was really nice and we enjoyed walking around Astoria. We will definitely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The location was great! Just 2/3 blocks away from subways station. Not too long of a ride to enter Manhattan. Near an amazing brunch place called sanfords & for great Acai bowls try fusion! JP was available by text or around the apt. Easy going & communicated well. Enjoy your stay because we loved it!!! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Excellent place to stay. Was really quiet. Was not that far from Manhattan and makes getting around really convenient and easy. Joao is an excellent host but the star of the stay is the beautiful Blue! Thanks for being such a fantastic host.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The host and the room was great at a good location not far from Manhattan. There was another tenant in the apartment but we hardly have seen him throughout the week so the apartment was basically ours. I would highly recommend the place for other travellers, it is value for money.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The location is excellent, very close (less than 5' walk) to the metra station. The guests are very friendly and Joao responds to emails/texts immediately. Their dog is adorable! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This is our second time staying at Joao's place and the experience was just as good as the first! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed with JP for a few weeks during the summer while working on the upper east side in Manhattan. For what I needed the place was great. The room is spacious and very comfortable for two people. There is also a desk to work at and another double bed to accommodate up to 4 people comfortably. The commute to Manhattan is easy (although the subway can be unpredictable). JP is a great host, communicative, and will help you with anything you need, wile also respecting your privacy. The area, Astoria, is also nice; there are great and reasonably priced restaurants of all cuisines nearby, a good laundromat a 5-minute walk away, a large supermarket around the corner, and importantly it feels safe.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The room was huge, with a nice and big double bed, desk, chairs, a big TV. Everything was clean and tidy. Bathroom, living room and kitchen were also Ok. We had not chance to meet Joao because he was away on those days, but he had a friend there and provided us everything we needed. He also has a super lovely dog (Blue) who always comes to say hello, but does not make any noise at all. Transport was very good, with a subaway station 5 minutes away that toke you to Manhattan in 15-20 minutes. We absolutely recommend this accommodation.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Joao's place was very clean and located near several good restaurants and easy MTA access to Manhattan.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good experience, Joao is very attencious. His place have a very good localization near to subway and very calm neighbohood. Joao gave me some tips about NYC and public transportation. I recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is really cosy and great to live in! It is also in a very good location and close to all the best places by Subway.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Joao's place is centrally located with easy access downtown and the airport. We felt safe in the area and enjoyed the many bars, deli's and restaurants. The food van on the corner of 34th st was excellent.  Must Love Dogs, Blu was awesome he made us feel so welcome every time we came home. We were also surprised at how quiet it was. Overall we enjoyed our stay and found it more pleasant than previous hotel stays.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very convenient from the subway and  places to grab something to eat. Bed was big and comfy, we had a good sleep! Joao is very nice and his dog is super cute and quiet! We recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>João is an absolutely charming host with a delightful dog called Blu. Prior communication went like clockwork and he was entirely unfazed by our check-in in the middle of the night. The apartment is conveniently located in a safe residential area with  good amenities, and the room is clean and spacious. The shared bathroom and kitchen spaces are also clean and well equipped. We didn’t see much of João, who looks to be building an impressive film-making career for himself, but the interactions we did have were friendly and fun. However, we were greeted every day with a new cuddly toy by João’s adorable pup Blu, who loves to have new humans to play with. We would recommend João’s place without any hesitation and would love to come again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Do not hesitate, just book Joao's place. It is absolutely amazing. Short walks to MTA. Lots of thoughtful touches in the apartment and very clean. Couldn't ask for more.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place is in a good locatioj but the host isn’t so social.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This was my second time at JP's place and it was even better than the first time, and I thought the first time could not be beat. The room is big and spacious. The location is close to the train and close to so much amazing (and affordable) food. The apartment is so clean! And did I mention the king bed... I will def be keeping an eye out for this place in the future to book it again. JP is extremely accommodating and  responds quickly. This place felt like home.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our stay in Brooklyn was fantastic and we were hosted impeccably by Lucy for the entire 12 days. Everything was as expected and more. The area was super cool and close to the metro, surrounded by vintage clothes/ thrift shops, good pubs and coffee.  The room was private, comfortable and clean with high ceilings and a loft feel. Lucy left heaps of breakfast food for us in the morning - including locally harvested vegies and eggs.  Her kitchen is modern  and generally the house is spacious. I'm not a cat person, but the two cats were very sweet, keeping to themselves most of the time. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We enjoyed our stay at Mike and Lucy's home. They were away the first 4 days of our stay, but fixed this by letting a friend stay over, Claire, who was awesome! Just as Mike and Lucy by the way. They have a nice house in a good neighborhood, with lots to do and you're in minutes in Manhattan. The room is nice, clean, big enough with a good bed. Oh yeah, their cats, Leaf and Tilt, are really sweet! We really recommend this place to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was an amazing stay (the really really kind of amazing). Lucy and Mike are very welcoming and lovely hosts (they even offered us their wine and drinks in the fridge). Code and keys, everything worked perfectly. Their apartment is beautiful and very atmospheric. The room was exactly as on the pictures (even a bit bigger then it seems, and it comes with AC - good thing to have in summer) and was very clean, like the whole apartment. It's very close to a L-train station (less then 2 min walk). The neighborhood is the frontier of upcoming Brooklyn (and so it's changing quite fast at the moment). There is everything one needs: grocery stores, bars and cafes. If only AirBnB always could be like that. Thank you Lucy and Mike!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I used this rental as a jumping off point to show my dude my favorite parts of the city, and it was perfect for that! Our short stay was very nice. He's a friendly guy, the bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable, we each had our own set of keys, the place was right in the middle of everything good about the East Village, and it was super convenient to both the L and the 6.  Chris did everything he could to make sure we had a good time.  Y'all should stay with him! Thanks, Chris! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Chris is the ultimate Airbnb host. He accepted my last minute request, saving me from who knows what (didn't have a lot of other options in NYC that night). He was super communicative, super friendly and nice, and the apartment and the bed were also clean and comfortable. Located in the amazing east village, it can't be beat in NYC. I'd not only would stay with him again, but hope to become good friends as well as I transition to NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris is really nice and we had a good night in his place. The apartment is not far from NYU and the circumstance is safe. The check in time is flexible. The room is clean and tidy.Chris prepared some basic clean set for us. The only thing to me is that the bed is too soft and the AC is a little bit noisy. As a whole, we love this place and it is worth its price.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris is a very nice and open person. He hosted me and my friend, we stayed at his apt. 4 days. The arriving was a bit confused, because we came there in the morning and usually check in is in the evening, but finally we could check in at 2pm! He was really kind and helped out if it was needed. The apt. is really small and Chris sleeps at a plank (Website hidden by Airbnb) seems a bit strange (u sleep i his bed and he at a plank bed) bad for him it is the way how it works! The location is pretty good to explore Manhattan! East village has a lot opportunities for dinner, shopping etc.. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris was a great host. He was friendly and gave us some good tips about New York. The apartment was small but that was all we needed for a few days. My friend and I really liked the neighborhood. There were lots of restaurants and a close subway station. If you just need a comfortable bed and a shower, you´ll be good at his place. I will book it again if I plan a new trip to New York City.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Chris was a great host. He was very helpful and had a suggestions on how to get around and was nice to share his personal favorite spots to eat in the area. The location of his place was excellent. The room was clean and he even had the air conditioning on. He also provided soft fresh towels ( which we didn't use, but was great to have in case). It was in a lively neighborhood and I felt very safe. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris was a really awesome host. He had clean sheets and towels waiting for us. Not to mention the little soap/shampoo bottles he set aside for us to make us feel welcomed. He gave us recommendations of local places popular to that part of town like a cool diner or wine/cheese bar. We'd definitely recommend him for future stays in New York. The location was great and had tons of people around - safe for walking. Great little eateries all around and less of the crowd you'd get from the over populated areas of New York, Time Square/Broadway. A good retreat. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris is a friendly guy available to give you suggestion on the city. The house is in a good position to visit Manhattan.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The location was amazing. Chris was so far the most welcoming person I met. Comunication before arrival was perfect. We came quite late and he still gave us tips where to go and in the end went out with us.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great neighborhood! The flat is small with a good sized bathroom. In the wall between kitchen and bedroom above doorheight there is an opening which allows light and sound to move freely in the flat. The flat is on ground level facing a quiet cozy backyard with at table and chairs.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Chris was an amazing host! Very accommodating with our schedule and such as welcoming host. The space was better than pictured! Very clean and bright, it is in the perfect location. Less than a few minutes walk from anything from great restaurants, bars coffee shops and major subway lines. He was easy to get ahold of and meet up to let us in on a Sunday evening. We came in starving and he suggested a great restaurant near by, even walking us there so we wouldn't get lost! Could not have been a greater experience for a first timer in New York!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing time in NYC. Chris opened up his home very kindly and was an amazing host! The apartment was very cozy and the area was excellent. I would absolutely go back again!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Chris was an amazingly friendly and helpful host and did his best to accommodate us. He was in touch with us the whole day prior to our arrival. Although we couldn't came in at the promised time, but Chris was still very nice about it and made sure we were all settled in before he left the apartment to us. He gave us an online map with notes that he made to help us better locate surrounding stores/restaurants/bars in the area. The apartment was very neat and cozy, the bed was very comfortable and clean. We really enjoyed our stay with Chris and would definitely recommend this place!!!!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris is very nice. The room is warm and clean. He has a good taste, the decorations are beautiful. The sheet and pillowcase are very clean. A nice trip for me.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris is a wonderful host! We primarily chose his place because of the good reviews he has gotten in the past and we were not disappointed. He was flexible with the check-in and check-out times (which was very helpful to us!), responded very quickly and it felt more like visiting an old friend than staying in a stranger´s appartment. The appartment is small, but clean. Fresh towels were provided. One of the highlights was the map he made with all the good places to go around his neighborhood. We would happily stay with him again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was like walking into a friends house. Chris was super accomodatig, showed us the ropes, gave very good pointers on local places to visit. The location was ideal - we walked everywhere! \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My boyfriend and I stayed here and found it to be perfect. Chris is lovely and a fantastic host. He went out of his way to accommodate our arrival time to New York which was lifesaving. The place was great and had everything you could want. The location is amazing. I hadn't stayed in East Village before but will definitely be back. Highly recommend staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Chris was a very friendly and flexible host. He met us during his lunch hour to let us drop off our belongings earlier. He was also extremely welcoming and even brought us to a local bar for drinks. The neighborhood and location is amazing with lots of great cafes, restaurants, and bars. Thanks for a great stay Chris!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris was a great host and made me feel welcome . He met me right on time and even took me around to a couple of spots in the EV . The apartment was clean and cozy and the bed was very comfortable. He was very helpful in giving me directions and places to go . A perfect location , close to trains and plenty to do and see even if you just stayed in the EV . I hope his place is available the next time i go to NYC . Chris is truly a good person and New Yorker .\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chris is super awesome and friendly. He knows the good places to eat around the city. He made a map with all the cool spots on it.  Chris' place is in a really good location.  The metro line is 3 streets. Chris' apartment is clean,the bed is big and comfortable. The neighborhood is also safe. I had a really great experience. Next time I'm in NYC, I'm booking Chris' place again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My friend and I stayed at Chris' apartment last week and it was great! Location was amazing! Bed was so comfortable! Chris was really really helpful and friendly. He gave you space but was also around when you needed help with anything. Definitely staying there again. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a wonderful week in NY. Chris is a really friendly guy, the bed is good and the location is very nice! As a couple we missed our privacy a little bit because the house is cute but very small. I would recommend it to friends though!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I spent amazing six weeks staying in the apartment of Emily and Jimmie! The room is very clean and its interior makes it cozy and creative. Emily and Jimmie will provide you with everything you need and will help you with advices about the surrounding area.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing two weeks staying at Jimmy and Emily's NY apartment. From the moment we arrived, Jimmy made us feel very welcome and took us on a tour of the area. The apartment's location is a perfect hub to discover NYC. It is literally a stone's throw from the north of central park and a 30 second walk to the 2/3 line which can get you to times square in about 15 minutes. The apartment is exactly as we expected and described. Our room was cosy and bed super comfortable. Jimmy and Emily are lovely, genuine people and could not have been more accommodating. I would without hesitation recommend them to host anyone looking for somewhere to stay in NYC. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Jimmy is the nicest host I have ever met so far. The apartment looked like an art piece and felt like home. The listing description was accurate. The neighborhood was relatively clean and safe, worked perfectly for my late-night runs. It was an excellent experience.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jimmie is a good host, welcoming and responsive. My stay was smooth and all went according to description. I am thankful to both Jimmie and Emilie for opening up their home.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was so good to be at Jimmies home, everything was the way he described. The shower is awesome, the bed is amazing, so near to the subway. I will certainly come back.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The place is amazingly located, the price is right. There is a bit of noise from the park and the building is very old, but that makes staying here a really authentic New York experience.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Jimmie and Emily have been outstanding hosts. The apartment is very cute and clean and the bedroom very cozy. Most importantly, the two were such a nice couple and incredibly friendly and easygoing. Whenever I had a question, they were there to help out, and to provide tipps. Such amazing hospitality! And they have a really adorable fish, which is the funniest of all times :D I really loved staying with Jimmie and Emily and can highly recommend the place. I wish the two all the best for their future!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed here for about 2 months. This is a delightful space, and the hosts are really responsive. Great location if you need to commute to Columbia as I did. A few good restaurants and coffee places nearby, but not to an overwhelming extent. An added bonus is the in-building washers/dryers. All in all, I’d definitely recommend staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Amy and the apartment were perfect! Not only was Amy responsive and cheerful, she was also extremely considerate. As to the apartment, it's very well kept, well lit and nicely decorated. The bed is comfortable and the apartment stayed warm despite how cold it was outside. The location is great as well. It's a safe area (I have several friends who live near by) with a metro station less than 5 minutes away. On top of that, there's really good food in the area!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Amy was an excellent host. Apartment was very spacious. I had a great stay. Easy check-in and check-out instructions. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I felt very welcomed into the apartment. The apartment looked like the picture from the website. Communication was key and our host was prompt with responding and very friendly. She checked up on us to make sure we had and understood very thing we needed to enter the apartment. The neighborhood was good and nice because it was close to transportation and places to eat. We felt respectively at home and enjoyed our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very pleasant stay at Lee's place. The location was in a residential area of Williamsburg, calm & safe, and close to L train which made things very easy when it came to commuting. The flat was very hip & tidy which made a perfect first impression. It was very comfortably accomodating 2 people in different rooms (one bedroom and one bed in living room), and had a cozy kitchen & bathroom that meets all basic needs. I would recommend Lee's place to anyone who would like to travel to NY, good value for such conditions.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great stay at Lee's place. A good spot to explore Williamsburg, close to good bars and brunch places. Plus the metro stations are close so it's easy to go back and forth to Manhattan :) </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Haley is very responsive and caring host. Her place is in a very good location, close to nice bars and restaurants in the neighborhood and to the metro. The house is very cosy and has all the amenities we needed. We loved staying there! Thanks Haley!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great place in an amazing location! I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a lovely home in Brooklyn!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lee's place was fantastic. Well located on a quiet, residential street and walking distance to wonderful amenities. The space is huge, comfortable, and cute. Everything about staying there was convenient, and Lee left lots of recommendations for nearby food and drink that proved to be top-notch tips. Lee was also an excellent communicator. She sent detailed instructions prior to my arrival and was quick to respond during my stay as well.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We loved the Greenpoint apartment. It looked amazing, was clean, had a full working kitchen, perfekt wifi and everything we could ask for. And we felt totally spoiled whit the cleaning och chancing of towels and linnen every week, even if the cleaning could improve. Vida and Kevin was super helpful and friendly as well. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Stay was amazing! Super cool loft space with nice touches and everything I needed! Host was super easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay again!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Oh, excellently!!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We came back to Seth’s apartment, and the second stay was as good as the first. (See our earlier review dated July 2014). Seth was again helpful and accommodating – late check-out no problem. It’s a good location for walking to the many excellent eateries and bars in this part of Brooklyn, with dedicated walking/jogging and cycling lanes along to Pier 2 and beyond. A great find.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans un quartier calme (cela fait du bien après de longues visites en journée). L'appartement est conforme aux photos, très bien équipé (il ne manquerait rien dans la cuisine pour se faire d'excellent repas), propre et fonctionnel (un petit bémol sur la salle de bain et les toilettes qui mériteraient un petit coup de jeune). L'appartement est à 15 minutes de la station Caroll Street ligne qui vous amène dans Manhattan. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My experience with both Seth and the apartment was excellent. Everything was as described in AirBNB and the apartment looks better in person than in pictures.  The fully equipped kitchen was a big plus.  The apartment AC functioned very well and wax particularly appreciated in July. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Carroll Gardens is an amazing place. I was so surprised at how quiet it was, just the sounds of children playing. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great apartment and location and good communication throughout. Thanks again.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>As soon as I arrived I felt so welcomed into their home. I absolutely loved my stay at Inez’s place. The most sweetest genuine couple ever! They were always so kind towards me and always there if I had a question or needed help. It was great to chit chat with them also after a long day. I loved the house its very tidy and neat, warm and cozy also i loved my room. I’m happy I got to stay here and it was my first time using Airbnb, kind sweet people who are absolutely amazing hosts! ❤️❤️</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Inez was an amazing host for my family friend visiting from Korea. She was so easy to communicate with and made this trip easy and comfortable for him.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My husband and I loved our stay at Laura and Luke's place in Brooklyn.  It was perfectly clean and spacious, beautifully ornamented and well equipped, and very comfortable.  The location couldn't be better: steps from amazing restaurants, shops (grocery and other), and multiple subway lines and stations.  We particularly appreciated the guide that Laura and Luke put together for us, detailing some of the best restaurants and watering holes and some not to be missed, but often overlooked, NYC activities - complete with personalized recommendations on what to order!   \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a fantastic time in this beautiful apartment. The location was great and the hosts were really helpful with recommendations. The apartment has good facilities and is a great base to explore New York.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location! So so close to the best ramen places in New York if you are a big fan of ramen( or food ). It's very cosy! I had a really good stay. I really hope next time I come to New York I can come back =)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>really flexible with our check-in time as unexpected things came up to delay us.  clean and perfect location for exploring NYC for the first time.  We were minutes away from times square, the theatre district, the bus station and there was even a huge food festival on 9th street happening that weekend - amazing!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Le logement correspondait bien à la description, un excellent lit grand et confortable, un placard pour ranger ses affaires. L'appartement est bien situé à 8 min de time square à pied et à 5 min du métro. Commerces et restaurants à proximité (en bas de l'immeuble). Les hôtes sont très rarement présents, et c'est la liberté assuré car vous avez l'appartement pour vous tout seul, possibilité de se faire à manger soit même. \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Grate time at this very good located spot. If you look for a place near almost everything this is it! Clean, tidy, good neighbourhood, etcetera.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good area, good room, nice apartment and nice host. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I have a really wonderful stay at Pj's place.

Nice kitchen. Overall very good stay. Would definitely come back if I visit NY again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It's a good place for discovering NY. We got a lot of impressions staying here. There is comfortable kitchen, good wi fi, it's really close to time square and subway. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartement was clean and the room comfortable. Everything worked out great. The apartement is right in the center. Very good location. I would go again. Thanks for all this.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice place, good location, clean. Steve very accesible with the checkin time </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>From the moment I made the request everything worked out smoothly. Communication was good, and the handout of the keys after my arrival was on time. Patrick´s appartment is cozy, spacious and you really feel like you are in a home. The room is comfortable for two people, it even has a closet! The bathroom is clean. The kitchen is well appointed, has everything you need. Everything was as shown on the add. Wi-Fi works well. The location is also adequate, five minutes from the E,C subway lines. In summary, a great experience, would stay again in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My stay was good at pj's place, the location was very handy and convenient with lots of places to eat nearby. The room is a 2 floor walkway as mentioned so it might be a little difficult with suitcases and I found the room a little cold but there is a heater which was good. Apartment is clean and cosy, smaller than expected. Great price for the location.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The neighborhood was good, a bit of a walk from the subway. The room is up 2 flights of steep stairs so if you have a lot to carry it is a challenge. Was I made to feel welcome -- Steve was a little helpful, but no frills here at this airbnb. The lamps either didnt work or didnt have any lightbulbs, but Steve fixed one up for the bedroom. The bed was super, it was quiet I thought. The place was clean. Would I stay there again...maybe.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great neighbourhood, really vibrant. Was lucky enough to stay when they'd closed off the avenue beside the apartment for a food festival. PJ was away but his housemate Steve was very friendly, greeted me and showed me up to the room, with good instructions for the flat and room. Bed was large and comfortable, street was quiet so had a great night's sleep. Would recommend :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing stay at PJ's place. We stayed there as a couple for 5 days.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"New York: A city on steroids...good steroids. The host \"\"undersold\"\" the apartment. It turned out to be better than what I expected at that price and almost too good to be true. There are no catches!!!!!!!. It is a modern neat and clean apartment with all the mod cons and one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in.  It is close to everything: Times Square</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Had a great stay at PJ's. Didn't get to meet him, but his friend Steven was very nice and helpful. Everything was organized and easy. The apartment is REALLY nice, clean and quiet, and the location is amazing. Couldn't ask for more. On the fridge you can  see all the notes other travelers have left for PJ upon checkout. One glance at them I knew I wasn't alone in my satisfaction. Hope to stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Well, I was there for one week and was wonderful, good location, comfortable place, and PJ is a nice guy. I had no problem being there, and I recommend.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great apartment in a great area! Tons of amazing restaurants. Close to Times Square and Central Park.

We felt quite well in the place.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We met with PJ's friend Steve who allowed us to check in early, as we arrived earlier than the check in time. He was extremely pleasant and helpful for whatever we needed. The apartment is clean and fairly quiet for its location so close to the downtown core. It is conveniently located so my friend and I were able to walk to just about everywhere we wanted to go. The bathrooms were clean, we had fresh towels and linens placed for us in our room when we arrived. I would definitely recommend this place. It is just a short walk to Times Square, Central Park and amazing restaurants and bars close by. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Such a good apartament in a very good location!

It’s a little noisy, but I admit that we could sleep usually good.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great place with a great value to stay in NYC!! First of all you have tons of space, because you have an entire floor for yourself. The (very pretty!) house is also convenientely located for public transportation (7-10 minute walk to A/C and G line) and groceries are just around the corner.  Omar is a great host and ensures that you have everything you need and can also give you very good information about the neighborhood and a lot of stuff to do! Was a pleasure to meet you Omar, we will definitely get in touch with you again for our next trip to NYC - highly recommended!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at Omar’s place was absolutely great! Omar is a fantastic guest: friendly, kind but also very discreet, he’ll surely make you feel at home. The place is very nice: he rents an entire floor of his beautiful house, in a very pleasant neighborhood in Brooklyn. He also has two friendly cats, which for us was a plus. The house is clean, quite close to a subway station and has a good internet connection. We have been at Omar’s place for more than a month, and we had a fantastic time. We definitively recommend Omar’s house!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This place is great and in a great neighborhood. Close to the subway, close to shops. The appartment is very spacious and quiet. Omar is great host with good advice. I definitely recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our stay was very pleasant : Omar is nice and helpful (good advices about the art galleries and museum in New-York, cafe and bakeries,...), the neighborhood is quiet and Brooklyn is restfull after all a day in Manhattan.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar was very responsive, with spot on information.

The location is also very good, with close by subway, grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. Definetely recommended and we will go back!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Omar was an excellent, kind and considerate host and made me feel very welcome. If anything the quality of the apartment exceeded the very attractive pictures on the website - very spacious, elegant, comfortable and scrupulously clean. I found this part of Brooklyn to be a vibrant and fun area - quite like my own part of London - and really enjoyed getting to know it. It was also a very easy commute to and from Manhattan, and even easier to the airport. For me the whole experience was like a \"\"home away from home\"\" and I would love to go back sometime if possible.\"</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Omar is an excellent host, he's discreet and at the same time can have a most interesting conversation about many subjects. He offers much more than a bedroom, not only because   there is a private bathroom and a living room at the guests disposal. The area is quiet and safe and there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. We really felt at home.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was my first experience renting a room in a house and couldn't have being better!!! Omar is a very diligent host. He always answered right away to all my messages and was patient while I made my final decision. We were in permanent communication before my arrival and he waited for me considering it was Saturday afternoon. The bedroom, restroom and living room look like in the pictures and they are clean, very comfortable and are for your exclusive use and nobody is going to bother you. I didn't cook this trip but I could do it, since I was allow to use his kitchen and fridge without problem. The house is a nice old house totally restored and is located in a good street. I followed Omar's recommendations about supermarket, coffe shops, restaurants, subway lines to commute around and have no complaints about them. Most of the time, I commuted to Manhattan with the C train from Franklin Ave and never felt any insecure situation walking to or from home. I really enjoyed my stay at Omar's place and recommend it, I'll try to rent it again in any future trip to NY/Brooklyn. Thanks Omar!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We stayed at Omar's place for 9 nights and had a wonderful time. The two room are spacious and clean, Omar provides everything to make you feel like home. His house is located in Brooklyn, which I found is a nice contrast to busy and 'touristy' Manhatten. Anyway, there is a subway station near and transportation is fast in New York. Omar is a very helpful and reliable host and our stay was another amazing airbnb experience. I totally recommend Omar's place for a NY vacation. Thanks for everything, Omar!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We absolutely loved our ten-night stay at Omar’s place. The rooms - bedroom, bathroom, living area - are spacious, high-ceilings, clean, comfortable, sunny and quiet, with all the amenities a busy traveller would need - a kettle and morning tea/coffee, a hair dryer, a good Wi-Fi and an easy short walk to the subway towards Manhattan. You get a lot of privacy and it feels you pretty much have the whole floor to yourself. Omar is friendly, helpful and practical, and we thoroughly recommend this place. We’re already saving for our next visit! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My first Airbnb experience was amazing. Omar is a great host. He kept in touch with me via text messages from the moment my friend and I arrived in NYC, and provided tips and things to do around the neighborhood. Speaking of which, Omar's house is in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a short distance away from several subway stations that take you straight into Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn and Queens. We felt very safe walking around the area, and there are great places to eat for cheap (pro-tip: try Pilar's Cuban Eatery just three blocks from Omar's place). \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>we had amazing time in NYC and Omar was a really nice host. He is always helpful, really interesting and always ready to help. the flat is stunning and really easy to access. he recommended us a lot of places and made everything to make us feel home. and it worked so good! we want to come back.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great time in New York. Brooklyn was a good starting point to visit the city. Location was quiet and peaceful. Nice atmosphere in this suburb neighbourhood.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar is a really good person. He has a very good, clean and comfortable house. We really had the whole second floor what was cool. Omar is always friendly and can help you.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed 8 days in Omar's house and had a great time. Omar was very nice and helpful, picked us up at the subway since we arrived late. The neighborhood is a good mix, everything is easy to reach: bus or subway to Manhattan. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is the second time me and my wife stayed with Omar. His place is amazing! The location is great, the apartment is spacious, and it is always very clean. Omar is also very good with communication and makes us feel very welcome. Definitely recommended. My first choice every time I have to go to NYC :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My husband and I stayed here for 8 nights and we loved it! The location was near the C train so it was convenient for us to go to Manhattan whenever we needed. The rooms were spacious, clean and very well-maintained, we didn't have a problem at all! Omar was a delightful host who was kind enough to let us check-in early since our flight arrived early in the morning and gave us good tips on what the neighborhood has to offer. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely choose this property again when we're back in New York!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar is a very diligent host, always available to answer promptly to any question  by airbnb mail, phone message or personally. This is my second time at Omar's place that means that I have had good experience the first time. The place is confortable with everything you need for a short stay. I like the space and the privacy during my stays. Having a living room (for my private use) besides of the room is a plus not easy to find. I feel at home. The house is located in a quite and residential area with a supermarket very close and just few blocks from the C metro station to move around Brooklyn or NYC very easily and secure. I really recommend Omar's place. If available, I'll not have doubt to come again next time in town. Thanks Omar for your hospitality.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I loved staying at Omar's place! An excellent, quiet place with tasteful and comforting furnishings for a quick New York visit. I would happily stay there again if I was in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar is a nice and helpful host. The floor is spacious. Living and bathroom are good, but sleeping room has overdue maintenance and bed is relatively small. Advertised pictures are a bit better than the actual situation. The neighborhood is OK, Wifi is good. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This is a lovely apartment in a convenient location near two train lines. The bedroom and lounge room are spacious, airy and nicely furnished, and the bathroom is clean and well-equipped. The suite is excellent value considering that it is almost like having a private apartment, the only difference being that the kitchen (downstairs from the bedroom in the studio) is shared and there is a young family living above the suite (they are not at all noisy, but if you plan on making noise yourself this may not be the place for you). Omar is a very responsive and helpful host.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This was an amazingly large space. Better than we expected in a beautiful brownstone. We'll be back.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar is a very nice host. His house is a beautiful brownstone building. And the place is cozy, well designed and convenient. Actually you have a whole floor for yourself with a bedroom, a living room and a bathroom what is almost like having a private apartment. The location is good, between two subway lines. And Omar is very attentive, helpful and also responds very quickly if you have any needs or questions. We really liked his place. It was a great experience! Hopefully we will be back. Thank you, Omar :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar's place is not only very clean, comfortable and spacious, but he has nice amenities like coffee, tea, snacks in the room, and the location is very good for getting to know the charms of Brooklyn. This was our second stay at Omar's and we will definitely return.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>What a beautiful historical brownstone built in 1889. So much character and enjoyable. There was alot of space, a good amount of privacy and very close proximity to the C and G trains. We enjoyed our time.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice private floor in a quiet house located conveniently between two subway lines. Omar is a very friendly and helpful host with good tips of where to eat and have breakfast. We really enjoyed the Bed-Stuy location as a basis to explore Brooklyn, including areas like Williamsburg/Greenpoint, Bushwick and Prospect Park. Manhattan is also just a 20m subway ride away.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I already stayed at Omar's place three years ago. We came back this year because it is so lovely. There can be no better host than Omar. The location of the house is very good, two train stations are close by. Everything is exactly as shown in the pics. Even prettier. We can highly recommend Omar's place. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is an amazing home staying. Omar is an artist. he is a  so nice and kind gentleman. We can use the whole second floor. This is a big bedroom,a nice living room, a big and clean bathroom. You can take a bus or a subway to every where.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar is an exceptional host who will go out of his way to make you feel welcome. The guest area which includes bedroom, bathroom and living room is spacious and stylish. There is an air conditioning unit and coffee/tea facilities in the bedroom. The area offers a good choice of shops and cafes, the nearest subway station is 5 mins away (G line) and the B52 bus stops right on the apartment doorstep. Very convenient to explore other parts of Brooklyn from here and Manhattan is only 20/30 mins away. This was our second time at Omar’s place and are already planning a come back.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We have enjoyed hospitality from Omar. He took care of our well-being all the time. He suggested very good restourants in a neighborhood. We really enjoyed stay at his apartament! \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar was a good host, accommodating, very helpful in making suggestions to good restaurants and directions to the neighborhood, airport.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Can't recommend the place enough! A whole floor, gets great light, and Omar is a very nice host. The neighborhood is lively but the street is quiet. I booked the place for my mom who is in her early 70s and she really liked it, so also a good fit for older travelers...</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar's place was as advertised and we loved staying there. We had a whole floor to ourselves and it was very spacious and great value. The bedroom was surprising peaceful and all the appliances worked well (shower was v. good) Omar was quick to answer any questions over the app and in person and had great local knowledge. It was overall super pleasant experience!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Beautiful, very bright and spacious sleeping and living room with a very friendly and helpful host! We spent 10 days at Omars place and had a great time thanks to the good location and positive atmosphere in the house.

The location was good, close to subway that leads to Manhattan. Would definitely recommend</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Omar's place is beautiful and welcoming. We loved the smooth wood floors, the art, the furnishings and books. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious, excellent water pressure. We made coffee in the room, storing our creamer in the fridge in Omar's studio. We had everything we needed. It was quiet and relaxing. Omar was a great host, showed us everything we needed, available for questions, we felt welcomed and at ease. The neighborhood is awesome. Markets, coffee shops and restaurants on every corner. Excellent access to multiple transit lines. We will definitely stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Omar was a very good host. He provided every information we need with quick replies. His place was really spacious, quite and nice. Everything was as described and we enjoyed our stay.  I definitely recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had the pleasure of staying in Omar's house for a week. The reviews are all great and I can understand why. Omar was lovely, very helpful and a very relaxed and welcoming host. The house is great and has been lovingly restored and looked after. The space and furniture are really nice and the place felt quite private even with an apartment on the two floors above and the owner living below. There are three rooms to use, including a bedroom to the back of the house overlooking the garden, a bathroom, and a living room in the front of the house overlooking the street. The location is very good too. Good places to eat and have a drink locally. Then there are four subway stops in easy walking distance, to get to Manhattan, Bronx, other parts of Brooklyn etc. Also in walking distance of Williamsburg. If staying a week I'd recommend a 7 day subway pass, very useful. I'd definitely stay at Omar's again!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What a dreamy Airbnb! Omar’s place is gorgeous, and you have a whole floor in this beautiful, airy Brooklyn building with a bedroom, bathroom and living room to yourself. It’s so tasteful and stylish, and we loved the touches like coffee and tea in the room and the amazing hospitality of Omar. He lives in the ground floor, along with the worlds sweetest cat who we were lucky enough to meet. Great location too, with lots of cafes and bars around. All in all a really excellent stay.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apartment is truly amazing, just like the pictures show. It is super spacious, brand new and decorated with very good taste. The bathroom (private!) is also brand new, beautiful and modern. Everything is 4* hotel standards, with the great advantage of feeling like at a personalised home. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We stayed with En (& Cakes!) for 7 nights and had a fantastic time. En's apartment is amazing, in fact it has even inspired us to change our own flat, the small details make such a difference! En was really welcoming (even though we arrived past midnight after some delays), giving us plenty of advice about what to do/where to eat etc. The location was perfect too, as much as we wanted to be typical tourists, we also wanted to experience the real NY. We could be anywhere in Manhattan within 20 minutes easy, or we had the option of walking to other places in Williamsburg. It really did feel like each night we was coming back to a home away from home :) \n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>En is an incredibly welcoming host. Not only the apartment is beautiful but she made us feel at home from the very first day. The guest room, the bathroom, everything was very comfortable. Everything exactly as seen in the photos. The neighborhood is as good as it gets. A few blocks away from Graham Av Station (3 stops away from Manhattan) and a short walk away from McCarren Park and Bedford Av. (area full of nice restaurants and shops). It was great spending time with En, Ryan and Cakes (her super cute cat), talking about our shared interests. We would happily stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>En was a great host! She provided us good information about the house and neighbourhood. The apartment is very clean, view from the balcony is very nice. The private bathroom is great, with a big showerhead and a jet tub. Bedroom is next to En’s bedroom and big enough for two persons. And the cat is adorable! Definitely recommend this place to visit NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>En was an amazing and welcoming host, my friend and I felt right at home. The flat is spacious, airy, and so chic and the room itself is extremely comfortable. We loved the little touches like the handmade soap and metro cards. Her cat Cakes and Hedgy the hedgehog were adorable!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was our first experience with Airbnb and it was a good one.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>En was a very friendly and easy going host. She has a very nice and quiet flat with a good subway connection and safe neighborhood. We can definitely recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My first Airbnb experience was completely amazing thanks to the special attention and care of En, Ryan & Cakes!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed 8 days at En's house. The house is true to the photos, very spacious and the room is a good size for two persons. A walk in closet is convenient for people who stay long time like us. The neighborhood is safe, and less than 10 minutes walk to the nearest subway station. En is friendly and will give some tour tips if you asked. She also gave as much privacy as you need. I definitely recommend En's house if you stay in NY.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This was my first Airbnb experience but En instantly put me completely at ease by warmly welcoming me into her beautiful and modern Williamsburg apt. The Manhattan views are amazing! The atmosphere is very relaxed and En and Ryan go out of their way to make you feel at home and free to use the apt. as your own, including setting the air conditioner at a comfortable temp. and utilizing the washer and dryer which I did, since I stayed 9 days.  En even invited me to share a glass of wine with her one evening! I highly recommend this Airbnb. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>En is an incredible lovely host, you completely feel like being at home and she is very easy when you want to cook or sit at the dining table. The room is amazing like the whole flat and it was wonderful to have my own bathroom. Would stay there again, thanks for the nice time En and Ryan!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We chose En's place very carefully for the location close to public transportation for the size of the room for the view on Manhattan, for the total space/surface of the appartment, for the private bathroom, for the good WiFi, the elevator, the dishwasher, the space for us in the fridge,... and we were really happy with what we discovered upon arrival as it was really matching our expectations. En and Maia are very nice persons. They made our stay even more pleasant with their help and good advise.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is attractive and beautifully furnished - En has a great eye for design! Between her place and the subway station are restaurants and coffee shops and a 24-hour grocery store. The bed is very firm, which was good for us, and the private bathroom is super. En was away, and her friend Maia was staying instead, and she couldn't have been more helpful. We also enjoyed Cakes, the cat, and the two guinea pigs. People with animal allergies will suffer here, but others will find the apartment very relaxing, the city view from the balcony charming, and the location convenient. Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great place to stay! I was looking to stay in Williamsburg, removed from Manhattan. It was a nice neighborhood with a subway stop 5 min within walking distance. You can get to Manhattan within 10-15 min. Very convenient location. We found some good coffee, bagel, and breakfast places within walking distance. Beautiful home with a cat who is so adorable! Host was extremely communicative and prepared for our visit. There were no problems with check-in even though we arrived close to midnight. En's friend Maia was there to assist, and she was very hospitable to us. The cost was extremely reasonable - private room and bathroom with access to living room/kitchen/tv. NY skyline within view too! I would highly recommend. Thanks for welcoming us En and Maia!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice clean apartment. Really good location. I normally prefer staying in a place by myself, but En was very nice and never in the way. She's very friendly. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apartment is amazing, you get what you expected from the ad on Airbnb! Apartment is clean and as shown in the pictures. The views from the balcony are great too (Empire State Building included)! Maia was a terrific host and helped us out with whatever we had questions with. The place offers also privacy whenever needed but also allowed for some conversations with Maia! In any way, we felt home right away!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>What a charming home in a charming neighborhood!  We really enjoyed our stay with En & her cat Cakes. The apartment is situated on a quiet street just a couple blocks away from busy restaurants, shops and markets.  We were so close to the L, we went to Manhattan every day. The apartment was perfect for us.  There was a private elevator down or we could take the stairway through the back door.  We had our own bedroom and bathroom, we shared the living room and kitchen with our wonderful host and mischievous Cakes.  My husband was very amused feeding, petting and talking to Cakes.  En was there to greet us when we arrived and to say goodbye when we left.  En's apartment is spacious, light and tastefully appointed.  We had everything we needed and more.  She provided us with high quality soaps and fragrant candles, as well.  I will definitely stay here next time.  It was the perfect location for us and we had a wonderful visit.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was our first time in an Airbnb and we had an amazing time and hospitality in En’s place, it’s really confortable and affordable. If you are looking for something nice and great location in NYC you should stay here. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a wonderful time staying at En's place - easy to reach & perfect location, stylish flat, have your own bathroom, room is big enough for 2 people (with open luggages:)), cute cat...etc En was super helpful, easy going and gave us lot of good tips about the neighbourhood and NYC.

The subway was two blocks away from the house and the area in Williamsburg had a lot of food joints and stores just around the corner. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>En's place is a rare find on Brooklyn -- or about anywhere for that matter. Large and comfortable room, stylish bathroom and an amazing kitchen (with an amazing balcony and view of the Manhattan skyline). Great location and great hosts (Cakes included).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Leah is a great, helpfull and friendly host.  Her flat is a very good location, beautiful, luminus, clean and the first point is that is near the subway 116th street (1min).\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Leah was an amazing and very welcoming host. She immediately made us feel comfortable and very much at home. She also gave very helpful tips about where to eat or what to do mainly in the Harlem neighbourhood.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I recently stayed one night in Leah's apartment. The room was wonderful. Very comfortable bed. Good location. Leah was a welcoming host and gave good advice on where to go and what to see. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Excellent hostess and excellent location.  We really enjoyed our stay in Harlem. The room was walking distance from everything we hoped to explore and then some.  Up to jazz at the American Legion on 132nd, down to Central Park and everything in between.

And HOPEFULLY we can catch Leah performing somewhere :) </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Leah was an excellent host, very friendly, the apartment is very clean.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My friend and I decided to visit NY last minute.

She made us feel like home. Great discussions & good laughs, we’ve been so lucky to hear her sing on our first night at french restaurant Chocolat.  Barawine is also a must and so is RedRooster, such an experience with its live jazz music!  Location is perfect, really close to the subway (4 stations to TimeSquare) and Central Park. The appartment is very clean, very cosy.  We would definitly go to Leah’s place again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Leah is such a great host!

We also loved how easy it was to take public transportation! There are metro stations very close by (one is literally at the corner of the block and only 4 stops away from Time Square!) There is also a couple of markets across the street, restaurants and a CVS which made it convenient for us. Leah made my daughter and I feel welcomed the second we met her.

She cared for our wellbeing and wanted to make sure we felt good about our visit.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Leah was very helpful and the building was in a good location for public transport! It was just slightly noisy due to the surrounding restaurants, but if that doesn't bother you, it's a cozy spot :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Leah’s house in very nice, in a really good location. Everything was clean and really good . Very fast responds. We were happy to stay there, and recommend everyone this place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>In June 2019 we stayed nearly one week in Leah's apartment. We came all the way from Germany for celebrating my wife's birthday in New York. We found a very clean, nice, and comfortable place which is well located in Harlem. A subway station is nearly in front of the door and good restaurants and shopping possibilities are within walking distance. And last but not least, Leah is a super friendly and superb host. In summary we have had a very good time and highly appreciated Leah's hospitality.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Leah is an excellent host, she permit us to arrive at 2am the first time for check in, we are grateful to her. The room and the bathroom were clean. It was very easy to go anywhere because the place is half a block away from the subway station. We didnt have any problem. Thank you again Leah.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We stayed with Leah for 5 nights and it was amazing!\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Grover is a nice host, very helpful and friendly. The apartment is located very close to the metro station, close to shops and restaurants in Harlem (although we didn't spend too much time in the area). City center is approximately 10-15 mins by metro. Rooms are spacious and cozy, good kitchen. We enjoyed our stay in this apartment and would recommend it to others as a value for money. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Our stay in this apartment was a really good experience. This was our first stay ever in New York and I am happy that I choose this apartment instead of a hotel. I was here with my familly ( we was 5 total )  and it was relaxing to \"\"go home\"\" in the evening and enjoy the calm of the apartment after a long day visiting NY. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This apartment as well as the service and hospitality provided by Grover were amazing! The apartment is what you see in the pictures and so much more!! You have everything you are going to need as if you were in your own home and more importantly it was very clean. The neighborhood has all of the charm and history of Harlem but it has evolved in many other ways. The neighborbood also has shops, restaurants, supermarkets and the subway station only a short walk away from the apartment. Grover was an excellent host. He made sure we had everything we needed and was always available to answer questions in a prompt and respectful manner. Thank you Grover. Do not be surprised if you hear from us again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a wonderfull stay at Grovers house in Harlem. Plenty of space, thanks to the three large bedrooms. Excellent beds for a good rest. Place was very tidy and cosy. I loved the paintings on the walls which were made by Harlem artists. The house is situated in a nice street. Enough shops around to do some shopping if you want to cook your own meal. Close to the metrostation. No problem coming home at 11 pm as 3 women.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Really spent a good time in Grover's house.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Grover was a great host, and worked very hard to make sure our stay was as enjoyable as possible. The house was beautiful, clean, spacious, safe, and well-appointed. The A/C units were a big plus. The neighbourhood had amazing energy, great restaurants within walking distance, and very easy access to the subway. Grover was born and raised in Harlem so he was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and navigation around the neighbourhood.\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The house was awesome, super clean, great location, very comfortable for many people, great area close to the train station and easy and fast to get to manhattan and anywhere in NYC, close to rest and shops (to buy food and do some shopping). Groover was an excellent host. I fully recommend this place, is so valuable for the price ask. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Grover was a good host, was understanding of our need to work with a translator (our nephew, by phone). The apartment was as advertised. Clean, spacious and well located in Harlem. It's really great to be close to a major public transportation hub (125th St.). There were 8 of us in our group and we had plenty of space, all clean and comfortable. A five-star experience!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This apartment was a really good base for a family with older teenagers. It is a simply furnished holiday let and has all the facilities you need if you wish to self-cater and lots of space to spread out. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Our stay at Grover's house in Harlem was the best choice we could have made. We were a party of 10 including 2 toddlers and it was amazing. The house is comfortable enough to accommodate us all, very well located, close to the subway (no more than 3 blocks, in a very nice safe area. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The check in process is excellent , the ficility is nice! However, the location is not convenient if you want to explore main spot in NYc</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My family of 6 adults had a great stay at Grover's. He was very approachable and quick to reply. We loved the location. It was a great experience being in Harlem. We felt very safe and there were lots of good shops and restaurants nearby. The subway was nice and close as well and made it very easy to get around town. \n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Stephanie (Grover's assistant) was amazing! My friends and I came into New York a little later than expected, and she was patiently waiting, so we really appreciated that! She gave us a tour of the home (3 floors! Wow!) and showed us where everything we needed was stored. The home was very clean and in a very nice neighborhood. Within walking distance of the subway, convenient stores (cvs, etc) and nice restaurants. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The only thing was that there were small bugs in the cooking pots and pans, but it was an easy fix. Great experience overall!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Grover is a really cool host, he's so kind and very nice guy. For sure I will return and recommend him. The apartment is warm, beautiful, big and better than in the pictures. Harlem is a wonderful neighborhood it has all the culture that you want to know, really safety, if you come please try Senegal food because it is amazing. My family and I are really happy for coming to NYC with an extraordinary host. Thank you so much Grover for everything, you rock! A thousand of thank you!!!!!! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Grover was an amazing host. The place was in a great location and was very clean. Thanks for everything </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Grover's place was an excellent base for exploring the city. The proximity to the metro lines on 125th is a big asset. The appartment was convenient for six people, even with the single bathroom. Grover was in touch regularly and was very informative about the appartment and the neighborhood. Besides the early check in everything was in order and to our wishes. It is seriously good value for money. Give it a try, Harlem has a lot to offer.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Really spacious apartment, the stairs just keep going down! Well situated for the subway, nice clean linen etc. Communication and assistance was very good, had a slight issue with the washer and dryer (which were great), and the issues were resolved in a very short period of time. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A very good trip. Thanks to the host.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A good place to live, let me have a feeling of home back</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Communication with the host was very good and open whenever necessary. The welcome book provided made navigating Harlem a lot easier. The home was mili-leveled and absolutely beautiful. Not to mention there was more than enough space for the 8 of us. Thank you for hosting us. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Grovers' place was located in the heart of Harlem. It was beautiful and it was easy to move around the city, Stephanie was the most excellent host, full of information and guidance. We were there for our daughter's & Godson's  sweet 16 birthdays and we completely enjoyed our stay, this was our first time using airbnb but absolutely not our last.   </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This place was amazing. It was so spacious and cozy. It was in the best location. Everything was in a good walking distance. </td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":49},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\nSELECT\nregexp_extract(comments, '(bad|worse|wrong)', 1),\ncomments\nFROM\nreviews\nwhere regexp_extract(comments, '(bad|worse|wrong)', 1) != ''"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .table-result-container {\n    max-height: 300px;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  table, th, td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n  th {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n</style><div class='table-result-container'><table class='table-result'><thead style='background-color: white'><tr><th>regexp_extract(comments, (bad|worse|wrong), 1)</th><th>comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>bad</td><td>Shalyn and Christopher are very nice and welcoming. Their dog Zuzu is adorable, and the quietest dog I have ever seen. The neighborhood is a bit shabby, but Bushwick is supposed to be the next trendy area in Brooklyn, so it can only get better. It felt very safe too. The subway is only 5 minutes away, and the trains take you to Time Square in less than 20mn. The place is very cute and clean, but I do not recommend it to people with bad knees since the ladder that leads to the bed is very steep and the steps are far apart. Also the sleeping space is a bit cramped, so if you are the kind of person who likes spreading their things, you will not feel comfortable. Other than that, if you are young and traveling light, I totally recommend Shalyn and Christopher's place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed at Barbara's apartment for approximately one month. Overall, staying with Barbara was not a bad experience. When I had questions or issues, she generally would try to help me. The closet was furnished with a good number hangers and the dresser had extra linens. The furniture was very useful for organizing my items for my extended stay. She also provided a trash can and umbrellas (extremely useful for the rainy weather here in New York!). The water in the shower heats up very quickly.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Brenda has been a good and very available host when needed. The apartment is very convenient for a stay in NY, and very well situated close to several stores and 5 blocks away from the subway. The only \"\"bad\"\" thing I can say is that the bedroom carpet is kind of old. We enjoyed our stay there and I will definitely come back.\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Will was a great host and his loft really is amazing. It was a great space to spend a couple weeks. The daylight in the room is great and the bed is really comfortable. Will was also very easy to communicate with even as he was abroad in Brazil. The only downside to the apartment is that the walls are remarkably thin so I could pretty much hear everything his roommate was doing and I felt bad waking up in the morning if he was still sleeping or coming back after a night out. Otherwise, it was a great space and a fun neighborhood to spend a couple weeks. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Thank you for your hospitality Ruby! We defiantly enjoyed our stay especially having the comfort of a home atmosphere. If you are ever in town you won't go wrong by staying with Ruby she goes above and beyond to help accomadate our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>we (my wife, 21th years old daughter, and myself)  stayed at andres's apartment for 9 nights. we found the apartment exactly as described and showed in pictures. although the ap. is very small, it has all you need: separate bedroom, convenient bad and opening sofa, kitchen with all you need, air condition, and very efficient wi -fi connection. the location is great: 10 minutes walk to times square, so you are close to most of the subway lines. although the ap. is in the center, it is totally quite!! we met andres when we checked in, and once more. i will definitely reccomend  this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Andreas seems a friendly and reasonable guy. He made sure things were going OK and he provided a late check out. The ground floor apartment is reasonably quiet. A cleaning fee is assessed. Given this additional fee, and given the room's price tag, things could have been cleaner. Two things to be aware of: Air quality in the apartment was bad. The air was very dusty and dry. Even with the thermostat off, the apartment too warm. The only way to get fresh air is to open the back door but it smelled of sulfur in the courtyard. We tried the fan on the air conditioner but it was also very dusty, as was the sofa bed. Consequently, the apartment left us all congested. Apparently Airbnb is poorly received by other residents. Basically we were told to sneak into the apartment when we arrived. This may entail initially leaving your bags with a third party. Surprisingly none of this is mentioned in the listing. Andreas said he informs parties that email him. We didn’t, so we knew only after paying. His email was a shocker. Relevant parts from his email below: “some cities have laws that restrict . . . tenants to host paying guests for short periods. . . . In New York City this has been a constant battle [with] the Airbnb community, so it is important for you to clearly understand . . we want to keep it quiet and low profile to be under the radar.   The most striking fact for any alert or possible complaint is . . people walking in the streets, and waiting outside of buildings with their LUGGAGE AND/OR CARRY-ONS. . . . So in order to prevent this t. . . situation I would ask you to please follow these instructions:   1.   I will kindly ask you to store your luggage . . (until 6pm) at a \"\"Luggage Storage Facility\"\" . . .. I will leave an envelop under your name with the apartment keys and instructions how to access the apartment. I will also arrange a “Car Service” . . to pick you up. . .and take you to the apartment. Your luggage will be store here until the end of the day</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>the photo shows only one wall of the room(good angle photo) , can't see in the picture that there isnt enough room to open the bad from a sofa mode nor the suitcase to be inside the room with you(not comfortable), the pipe of the house toilet and bathroom are going throuh the room so every time someone at the house will flush down the toilet you can hear that, the kitchen and bathroom of the house is in the upper floor wich you will nedd to climb on a squeaking wood stairs so every time someone will climb up or down the stairs you'r going to hear it( especially disterbing at night time), there isn't enough circulation of air in the room and when you open the A/C you'r brain is freezing because the room is so small that the A/C is pointed direction at you, the sheets dosn't smell very nice and there was a cover for the bad because it was stained so the sheets were on this febric that coverd the bad and becase of this the sheets kept going out from the bed and it was not comfertable nor hygienic.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Alice's place was awesome!! Perfect place to stay while visiting New York. Close to the subway, 10 minute walk to Central Park. Lots of restaurants and bars in the area. Her place was clean, and had all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. Furthermore, the place was quiet!! Unheard of New York right?...wrong. Thank you Alice for opening your place to us, when we visit again we will be sure to stay at Casa de Alice!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>My experience was great! A warm welcome and smiles all round. Rob took a chance on a damsel in distress, had he not, I wouldn't of met his lady Lizzie and their friend Marinala (that's probably spelt really wrong). The house itself is so homely, and I don't want to leave. If you are travelling a lot and want a home away from home, this crib is the way to go. It's close to the subway and Rob dawg and lizzle shadizzle are the best hosts a traveller could dream off. Oh and nice bed too! Thanks again guys, you the best. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything as described. Place is really nice. It is true that it takes 45 mins to the Times Square but it isn't bad, at least it wasn't for me and my friends. Andre was helpful and getting the keys was very easy. He even allowed me to stay up to 8PM the last day(if no one is checking in that day, late check out is possible).  On scale 0 to 10, place is 8 clean, but for this price you cannot accept more. Beds are very comfy :)\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Andre's place is exactly as pictured. While it is a well kept vintage brownstone, it is also very clean and comfortable. I had no problem finding free parking directly in front for an SUV both nights. I did not have- nor did I really need much contact with Andre. Though he was available by text. Everything was in its place really.  There is a cat and I am allergic, and even though its in the listing, Andre was good sport about finding a place for the cat. Not a bad stay.  </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Andre has been a great host and answered our call.  We checked in in the wee hours and it was raining, greeted by the cat as we got in.  We wrongly went upstairs as we thought the rooms are upstairs, sorry for that Andre.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Awesome place. Very close to 770 Chabad headquarters! Great value. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rich' lejlighed i Greenpoint var den originale AIrB&B oplevelse, hvor man rent faktisk bor i et rigtigt hjem, og ikke en upersonlig og kommercielt udlejningslejlighed. Dele-ordningen er virkelig til stede, -også når det kommer til indholdet i køleskabet og sæben i badet.  Rose House er desuden perfekt placeret og Rich's lejlighed er fredelig, skøn og hjemmelig, med den dejligste baghave- og samtidigt har man byens restauranter, supermarkedet og barer- få skridt derfra. Perfekt sted for vores familie på 4, og som vi bestemt vil anbefale til andre.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I hate to give bad reviews, but this is the review I would have wanted to read:\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was really good. It was a really nice apartment and totally clean/tidy and nicely furnished. It was quite big too and there was plenty of space for five people to stay in. We were even provided with a selection of drinks in the fridge as well as a Keurig coffee machine with a variety of drinks to make. The street it was on was pretty quiet and a nice street. It was about a 15 minute walk to the subway stations which weren't too bad but one of them was the C line which is useful for going to central locations. Edmund was a good host and answered any questions that I had. I would definitely recommend this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het appartement is heel ruim, zeker naar New Yorkse normen.  Het is gelegen in een rustig deel van Brooklyn.   Alle voorzieningen zijn aanwezig (volledig uitgeruste keuken, comfortabele badkamer, goede bedden, ...).  Zeker waar voor je geld.  Je bent wel even onderweg om naar Manhattan te gaan gezien het appartement een eindje weg is van de dichtst bijzijnde metrostations.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The NYC airbnb market is rough. You don't know if you're going to end up in a place with thin walls, a fruit fly problem, or something worse! Julian's place was none of these! It's clean, in a nice building, in a GREAT location, and it's quiet! My GF and I couldn't have asked for anything better for our 4-night stay here... definitely hope to stay here during my future trips to Brooklyn. Also, Julian responded promptly - communication was good - and even let us check in super early after our redeye to NYC. Thanks, Julian!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Annette is een vriendelijke gastvrouw wij hadden onze eigen douche,/badkamer naast onze kamer  een prima locatie in alle opzichten hoogst aanbevolen</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This place felt like staying at a friend’s, slightly cluttered, place. Perhaps I read the description wrong, but the photos are a bit misleading. While this is your own private apartment to stay in, it is the host’s home, and their belongings are all there. Bed was comfortable for two people, but the bathroom was a bit dirty, shower wasn’t draining properly, the fire alarm didn’t have batteries, and some of the host’s clothes were left in the window sill. Made it hard to find space for our own stuff. It was one block from the Q train, and about 30 minutes by subway to almost anywhere in Manhattan so that was convenient, however it is at the very north-east edge of the upper east side.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place is absolutely fantastic. Matthew and Vicki  were very accessible and accommodating. The apartment was just what we needed for a short business trip in the area. Everything we needed was within walking distance and parking wasn't bad at all. I would highly recommend this listing.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We stayed for six nights here. The positives were that the communication and check in with the host was very good and simple. The hosts were lovely and were there if we needed them but we had a full schedule and were out most of the day. The location was good as it was a few minutes walk to the subway and you could get to Manhattan in about 20 minutes or less. The neighbourhood was fine, it felt reasonably safe, and there's lots of shops, places to eat, laundrette etc, everything you might need was there. The room was a good size, plenty of storage. A wardrobe, chest of draws, the hair dryer was useful. Wifi was good and no issues with connection. Things you might want to know. Although this is a large room, the photos show it as being much lighter than it actually is. A few more lights here might be useful as would some black out curtains on the front windows to prevent the street light flooding. The room faces the the main road and although it's not an exceptionally busy through road there is still a high amount of noise that comes in (plus a car that goes up the road the wrong way at about 120mph at 3am every day!). Use of your own bathroom is great. However, be aware that to access this bathroom you will need to exit your room via the internal door (which is connected to the hallway leading to the open plan kitchen/dining area) and turn immediately left in to the bathroom. This means that if you're heading to/from the bathroom with just a towel round you then anyone in the kitchen/dining area will see you. We didn't have a huge issue with this at all but perhaps a French screen/room divider in the hallway would allow a little more privacy and comfort for some guests especially when hosts are entertaining/have visitors round plus it may assist in blocking out the kitchen lights which flooded into the bedroom. The greatest issue we had is that we barely slept for the six nights. This is because the room is located by the main entrance to the apartment block. The main entrance has two doors both of which are allowed to be slammed behind whoever comes and goes from the apartment block. The door frames were right by our heads on the other side. The block has three floors with two apartments on each floor (excluding the basement section). This means that with six apartments housing about 12 people (estimated) that those two doors got slammed a hell of a lot throughout the night. Practically every hour from 11pm through to 6am those doors were slamming away waking us up leading to a complete lack of sleep for our duration in New York. The other residents were either unaware that people sleep during the night and closing the doors quietly had never occurred to them or they just didn't care....</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Matthew en Vicki bieden een superfijne kamer met eigen badkamer, aan de voorkant van het huis. Op de kamer stond bij aankomst een bloemetje en op de badkamer zijn luxe producten en fijne handdoeken. Schoon beddengoed lag in de kast klaar, wat fijn is als je wat langer verblijft. De kamer is gezellig en slim aangekleed. Er staat een klein bureautje, waaraan wij ook vaak ontbeten, in de erker, er zijn extra stoelen en mooie kleedjes en sfeervolle verlichting. De boxspring slaapt heerlijk. Extra fijn is de grote inbouwkast + ladenkast, waar je al je kleding en spulletjes in kwijt kunt. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed with Gloria for 2 months and it definitely was a great time. The house is clean and you are able to use the kitchen as well as the living room and feel home!  If you stay for a longer term, there are many laundry places to wash clothes and also supermarkets just 1 block away. You will need a max. of 10 minutes to walk to the closest subway Station and the ride to Manhattan takes about 30 minutes. If you are in New York for vacation, this place is definitely a inexpensive choice and also a great Chance to experience Brooklyn. The neighborhood Bedstay used to have a bad record, but it has changed a lot and you will be safe! It is a gentrifying area that contains a lot of nice little Brunch places and cafes. The architecture is amazing and the People you meet on the streets are nice and friendly.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is well located, even tho the neighborhood is not the best (police and drunk people were running out during the night). The communication with them was very poor and I had to solve by myself some issues like bad odors that made my staying there unpleasant for a couple of days. The thing that I really didn’t like was their unprofessional way to communicate to me: the day before checking in, Nicole called me to tell me they are going to sell the apt and that there were people going during my staying to take pictures to the apt. Of course I couldn’t find anything else the day before my check in, and I’m pretty sure they knew about the pictures and selling their house weeks before: they wanted to make some money without considering their hosts! My feedback is 2 stars (on 5). The only good thing is the J train close to the apt, that gets you downtown Manhattan in about 20 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Can't go wrong with this place and the people who run it. If you are looking for a great place in greenpoint brooklyn this is it. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We never met Sally, but she provided to help us in reach the apartment and have the keys? She was also kind to take our luggages before the check in because we were traveling with three kids. This apartment is located in a superb position, just five minutes walking from the American museum of Natural History, the subway C-A, and Central Park. The structure of the apartment at the top floor is gougeous an in perfect New York style, with bricks on the wall, open space and a huge open space. We only suggested the owner to replace sheets and cushion that they were really bad. We hope she will do that! For sure you don't have to expect a newly restored apartment but a very well long lived one...but this has really fascinated all of us, spending there a lovely holiday!  For sure we will have our stay in our heart forever.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything as expected, nothing outstanding but nothing bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location in our favorite part of New York.  Very clean apartment just steps away from so many great restaurants and shops.  Susan made it easy for us to check in and out.  It is a hard bed.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but good to know depending on your preferences.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Joao was great. He waited for us to arrive even when we were 2 hours late due to bad traffic. He helped me carry my heavy suitcase up three flights of stairs and helped me with a dinner order that went wrong the first night. It was a pleasure staying at his place. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Goede ligging tov metro naar Manhattan. Kamer prima. Delen badkamer incl toilet met drie andere personen vergt wel wat geduld. </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The apartment is in an old building in the third floor without elevator. Everything in the apartment was misplaced and not very clean. The private bedroom was ok but it was worse than the pictures shown in Airbnb. The location was great, close to the subway.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Chris is a very nice and open person. He hosted me and my friend, we stayed at his apt. 4 days. The arriving was a bit confused, because we came there in the morning and usually check in is in the evening, but finally we could check in at 2pm! He was really kind and helped out if it was needed. The apt. is really small and Chris sleeps at a plank (Website hidden by Airbnb) seems a bit strange (u sleep i his bed and he at a plank bed) bad for him it is the way how it works! The location is pretty good to explore Manhattan! East village has a lot opportunities for dinner, shopping etc.. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Chris is an easy-going guy with a unique sense of humour. He welcomed us quite late, as he was on a business trip that evening, however he did everything to make us feel comfortable. The apartment was quite small and reasonable clean. Chris sleeps at a camp bed in the kitchen, which made us feel bad at the beginning, but I guess that’s the way it works, as long as he doesn’t mind. The location is perfect with shops, cafés and restaurants around, situated only a few minutes by feet to the subway. East Village is a safe place to be. We really enjoyed our stay, not only because I fell in love with Roger Federer ;)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I just recently visited New York with 2 friends for the first time. While my experience was a bit different, the stay there was OK.  First off Hailey is a very nice young lady. Although she very busy we were finally able to talk a few days before our arrival and she sent me an email and some recommendations which was nice. We were kind of skeptical since you have pick up the keys to the Appt at a local deli. Once we got the keys and made it to the Appt we were unable to get in for over 30mins because the key is a copy that doesn't really work well with the outside door. We had ask for help opening the door for the whole trip which become extremely aggravating and inconvenient! The Appt itself was clean but not as new looking as the picand it only has 2 beds and 2 sofas. It has a washer & dryer combo which is a plus but something was wrong with the washer it wasn't working properly its just stops for some reason. It was basic New York living kind of small but ample enough space for the 3 of us. The neighborhood was quite and safe which was great. Not far at all from the subway for those with no car. We did get a unexpected $40 parking ticket for street cleaning. Plenty of stores and eateries mostly Italian food and a few grocery stores. My friends felt it was a bit over priced once they got there and upset at the fact that there was no TV at all in the Appt but at that point what can you do.. We had sure we cleaned the place up before we left even though we were barely there to mess anything up but I think it was a OK experience for a first timer</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The apartment was spacious, comfortable, well-stocked, nicely decorated, and in a great location. You really can't go wrong with Seth's apartment, it is great value and I highly recommend it. I definitely hope to stay here again next time I'm in Brooklyn.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The only thing that I believe guest should know is that there's only one badroom for 6 people because there are in total 3 bedrooms (all in airbnb).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wij hebben een geweldig verblijf gehad bij Omar in Brooklyn. We hadden een hele etage voor onze eigen beschikking (slaapkamer, badkamer en living). Verblijf is erg schoon en ligt dichtbij een subway zodat je binnen 20 minuten in Manhattan bent. Omar is een zeer vriendelijke gastheer! Voor een volgende keer zouden wij dit verblijf zeker weer boeken.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een geweldig appartement, gelegen in een super leuke buurt van Brooklyn. Rustig gelegen in een heel veilige buurt. En was een perfecte gastvrouw. Zij liet ons gelijk thuis voelen en wij mochten van alle faciliteiten in haar huis gebruik maken. Ontbijten op het balkon met uitzicht over Manhatan, geweldig! Naast En was ook Cakes aanwezig, de ontzettend lieve dove kat die graag even aandacht komt vragen. Wij hadden een hele ruime prive badkamer met zowel bad als douche. Het hele appartement is licht wat erg fijn is. daarnaast is er ook nog de luxe van een lift die in het appartement uitkomt! Het appartement is precies als op de foto's weergegeven. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place is super cosy and great value for money. Subway is about a 20 min walk away making it easy access to the city. There is also the IKEA ferry between Wall Street and Red Hook that is super convenient and only $5 pp (note the times it runs!). Red Hook is really cool, with some hipster style bars and coffee shops, and an amazing BBQ grill. People might tell you Red Hook is a bad area, but we felt super safe. Also, there is an IKEA and Tesla dealership, so It can't be that bad.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This location is amazing and the hosts are quick and accommodating with their responses. Couldn’t find any bad food or uncool bars. And this space is a great launching pad. Highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I never met the host but the room is nice. Only downsides are that Internet/mobile connectivity are bad in the basement rooms and there is no AC for the hot days, but everything is very clean and well accommodated!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bimpie and her sisters were extremely sweet and helpful. Unlike the reviews I read prior to staying with her, the neighborhood is not bad. By sketchy I think some reviewers just meant that there were a lot of black people in the area. The train station is only a few blocks away, and compared to everywhere you have to walk in NY it was nothing. There is not AC, and it was hot. A fan helped keep me cool at night, but please keep this in mind. The bathroom and my room were clean. Bimpie helped me with any info that I needed. Thanks so much for having me ladies!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is not a bad place for the price. There is no window in the room, the air is not moving but you have fan in the bedroom. Bathroom was clean with hot water. It is a good place for few nights. Host’s communication was great.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>People were very nice and helpful. However the pics are a bit different from the reality. My room was downstairs, stinking very bad and pretty unsafe. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Helt okej boende. Läget var bra men rummet var litet och helt utan förvaringsmöjligheter. Ofräsch kylskåp och badrum. Massa rester kvar från gamla gäster</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Daniel is friendly, thoughtful, entertaining. His place is comfortable and just two blocks from the express train. Good food close by. Laundry convenient. Walkable to central park, museums, and the East river. You cannot go wrong. Definitely recommend. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We can't say enough nice things about this apartment.  The location was prime; just a 5-6 minute walk to the 4/6 train, there were multiple restaurants and bars within a 1 minute walk (seriously), and we could make it to Yankee stadium in under 20 minutes, and to mid town as well!  The apartment was clean, and Megan left us extra towels.  She has wi-fi and a chromecast on her TV in case you want to stream something.  We stayed out LATE night and never felt like we were in a bad area.  We really can't wait to visit NYC again and hopefully stay at Megan's!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Suzette was an excellent host, very friendly and easy to contact. Our flight was unfortunately delayed due to bad weather and she was really accommodating. The apartment is exactly as described, very clean, spacious and everything was in perfect working order. The location is absolutely ideal as a base for exploring Manhattan (The L train is THE BEST) or Brooklyn. There is a full supermarket 2mins away as well as plenty of convenience stores and places to eat. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This house was gorgeous, decorated with style, very charming. Ferry was 5 minutes by a car so it was easy to get up and go to Manhattan. One drawback was that old house came with lot of squeaks. Floors and stairs squeaked so bad, that if anyone walked up the stairs or used a bathroom it woke us up. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The house is really old and the room is not as nice as shown in the picture. The garbage in the kitchen needs to be taken out as it smelled really bad. We never got to meet the host and she did not respond to messages very quickly during our stay. However, the view from the ferry was really nice, which added some fun to our trip.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Landlord cancelled our reservation with no warning and did not give us an understanding as to why. Other house guests claimed she suggested they book their stay without using the air bnb app, they told us she did this so that she could abruptly terminate their reservation with no consequence of a bad rating.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The house is located in a decent neighborhood, though I would caution walking much more than a block away as it gets a little rough and run down.    Ferry is close, cab is only about $10 to get you to it.  The house is not lived in by the owners, they just rent out the rooms. I called when I arrived and did not see or hear from them at all since. Alissa seemed nice but busy when I called and did not really have time to talk.  We did get the two beds as expected though one was a mattress on the floor in a large closet that connected to another person's room.  It was a little weird as the door did not lock from my side. Actually our main door did not lock from the inside either, though it just needed adjustment.  House can be loud as others walk around and go up and down stairs, but was not a major bother, only the first night was really bad as the people next to my closet room came in late and were loud for a long time.  I am not complaining, I would consider staying there again as the price was decent.  Bathroom was shared with a few other rooms and was a wait sometimes, but again, not a big deal.   I would bring towels and cloths if you are staying for more than a couple days, though we were provided one.  I did not want to bother Alissa with another call so we put a water jug in front of the door that did not stay shut and just air dried our towel.    (Hidden by Airbnb) earth the area to see where you will be and you will have no surprises.  The home is a gorgeous and nicely decorated. I am a builder and have restored many old homes, this one is fantastic as far as being fairly original in many ways.  Best deal I could find and a definite must if you are looking for a clean place to stay near NYC!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My wife, daughter and I spent 3 nights here Sept 2016. The location was peaceful and in a pretty decent area. This is my first time to New York and I was surprised with how nice and helpful the people of Staten Island were. The ferry located about 2 miles away & only a nine dollar cab fare. I didn't actually meet the host, but she was available via messaging and I had her number if there were any issues. My wife is about eight months pregnant and after walking around the city all day she and her daughter wanted to lay down for a while. This was a good time for me to get out on foot and check out the neighborhood, which I was actually really pleased with. I spent a couple hours talking with a few locals I met, and it was really a cool experience. There were at least three other rooms rented out in the house when we were there and we only really had interaction very briefly. But even they seemed nice. As far as the cons, The floors were a little loud at night when people would come in and leave but it's an older house so that's to be expected. I sleep likely so I just woke up anytime someone came home late, but it wasn't an issue. The beds on the other hand, could use some updating. But I didn't feel like this was urgent or bad enough of an issue to contact anyone or make a big deal about it. It does feel good to get home so I can lay in my own bed because I didn't get much good sleep on either of the beds, but before I try to come across like I had a problem with this place, it was well worth the rate that we paid for it, especially given the location. We took the ferry to Manhattan several times both morning and night, and that was a really cool experience because you get to go past the Statue of Liberty plus it's free.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"I do not wish to leave a bad review, but rather an honest review of my experience with this host. I will start at the beginning so we are all on the same page. I had our trip booked for weeks when Melissa and Amanda asked us if we minded to be moved to a different home. I liked the first listing better but made the move. Melissa told me that she had a large group of young adults coming in the same weekend and thought we would appreciate the privacy of the new location. I said okay. One of them then requested that I agree to change my dates from Oct 5-9 to Oct 7-9 just to free up their calendar for others to rent. I then asked if my rental was still going to be the 5-9 if I accepted this change, to which both hosts answered \"\"yes\"\". When my guests arrived from Texas there were other people occupying our room. They immediately contacted me saying that the hosts told them we were not booked until the 7-9th. I was still two hours away at this point. This put us all in a panic as I did not have enough money to stay elsewhere for two days and my friends had all their luggage and an uber driver waiting outside. They nearly paid $650 for a hotel in the city when Amanda offered the basement in the home we were supposed to be staying in. All said and done my friends ended up paying over $100 for their Uber because they headed to the city and had to turn around. My friends also told me that it was made to sound like my fault for the mix-up. Luckily I still had the chat between Melissa</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Claudius is a gracious host who made sure we knew where everything was in the apt.  He is very responsive by texting if there are any concerns or needs. He charges $40 each way for airport transportation, which included him lifting our very heavy bags upstairs and down..a bargain!  The apt. is a bit dark since it's in the basement.  The bed was comfortable, but since it was practically on the floor, it was hard for me to get up and down (I am older with bad knees, so not Claudius's fault, just would have been nice to know bed is a very low platform type.). The apt. is located near a grocery store, a diner, and a train platform that doesn't run frequently but will get you into Manhattan and back quickly.  It was nice to be located close to airport and be able to get to Manhattan reasonably.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rose is a fantastic host and a very interesting person to talk to. Too bad I wasn't at the place most of the time! She was flexible as to the time of my check in and check out, provided me with all the information about the house, quickly answered to all my questions and did her best to make me comfortable. The house is clean and really nice, my room matched the pictures exactly. It's in a great place for transit with both blue and red subway lines really close. I would definitely recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We have stayed here over and over again, as we plan to in the future.  You can’t go wrong.  Much appreciated!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>No’t bad place at all! Building is old,apt is nice and clean,room is small with one comfortable bed!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Incredible first time I used to encounter Airbnb Ms. Fabiola so hospitable owner, location of residence of her class, but also very easy to find. Just two blocks from Times Square, each region is very convenient to Manhattan. And Ms. Fabiola have excellent language skills, even my English is so bad can handle, but also fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French. If the next time I come to New York again, or my friends, I will be the preferred her.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is great,the bedroom was comfortable and the bed slept well, the bathroom is very small. Theirs 5 flights of stairs to walk up with luggage, stairs are long and narrow, no good for handicap, and rough for bad knees. Best location for theatre district and restaurants, host very friendly and quick responses to text. I think price can come down a notch.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a very nice stay at Jason's Place. The room was clean and spacious, and the neighbourhood is actually quite calm for New York. It is a little bit far out of Manhattan, but not too bad. Also Jason was a very accommodating host and it was very easy to get into his apartment with his instructions. I would stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>There is nothing bad about this place. You get what you pay for. The location is good - it's only 40 minutes from Manhattan. The place is very clean and neat. We didn't meet Jason in person due to out busy schedule, but his instructions were clear. Would stay again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jason is really sweet. My room wasnt ready but he came right over to clean it. Thank you. I did however find a bedbug in my room (I took a picture of it) and a few small roaches in the bathroom. There was also mold on the bathroom ceiling. Overall the bedroom was clean. Looks just like the picture. The kitchen was also clean. The location is a bit far from the city but there are trains very close by. Not too bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is nice stay for shorter duration. Jason is very good in responding and communication. Metro station very nearby, it takes 30 min to reach Manhattan which is not bad. Quiet neighborhood. Would love to come back here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"It was a very smelly building, apartment felt extremely cramped and bad value for money considering the \"\"living area\"\" was non existent. I would not use this again nor recommend it. It is fairly clean thank God but that was the only recommending feature. \"</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We could not have asked for a better experience! Julie and her space are incredible. Add in the location, the building, the cleanliness, neighbors, rooftop views, etc., you can’t go wrong staying here. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Vinneth is a great host... She is very attentive and considerate.. That you could tell from the apartment which was lovely . The decoration and the arrangements of the datails made us  feel home right way.  She took care of us by having arranged flowers, fruit and water as  a welcome compliment. The rooms were all clean and and well equipped. Public transportation is nearby. We liked the idea of having a pieceful night without  a lot of noise. The garden looked very tempting- wrong season for that-  but next time we going to have breakfast outside;)\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay in Lang's place was not bad, mainly because the apartment's location is great. You can go walking to anywhere in Manhattan, really. Lang is very kind, and always answered very fast for us. Unfortunately, the building was very old, bad smell. Additionally, we didn't feel safe (we heard a lot of weird noisy all day and the building is open to anyone that wants to go to a neighbor which is a tarot reading). Finally, there is no lifts in the building. I recommend this place only for who wants to go with a lot of friend and don't want to spend much to stay in a very good location.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>So bad we decided not to stay at the place and make last minute arrangement at a different place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Voornaamste pluspunt is de locatie, op loopafstand van Times sq en Central Park. Appartement was niet bepaald schoon en is erg basic. WiFi na twee dagen stuk. Gevaarlijke situatie met elektriciteitskabels in de badkamer.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is old and the furniture are  old. The building has bad smell and all the doors in the apartment can’t closed because are broken. The restroom door opens to the kitchen, worse the restroom door can’t closed!!!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vilket kanonställe att bo på! Tunnelbanan och Central Park precis intill. Omtänksamme Craig svarade snabbt och tydligt när vi hade frågor. Michael hade en massa bra tips på både sevärdheter och var vi kunde hitta bästa restaurangerna i närheten men framför allt fick han oss att känna oss som hemma. Vi är verkligen glada för att vi valde att bo här istället för på hotell eller liknande. Det känns personligare och är ju dessutom i fantastiska Harlem! Att det var varmt och skönt samt att det fanns badkar uppskattades särskilt under (enligt vad som sades oss) den kallaste veckan på 60 år. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Only stayed here 2 nights out of the 6 I booked. Bedroom was clean and the bed comfy. Bathroom was a bit grimy and the cat litter smelled bad. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jessica is Great!  Friendly. gracious and willing to meet us at the very late hour of our arrival!  Everything went without a hitch.  Her place is so clean, peaceful  and lovely.   One of the best things was talking to people on the street.  We met families sitting on their porches who told us all about the changes needed from Sandy and where to eat and where to go...  Love the people around the neighborhood! Parking was a snap except once - and even then it was not so bad.  The massive beach was a huge surprise to us.  We wished we could have utilized it more.  Bungalow Bar and Restaurant is a few blocks away - go before sunset and just sit on deck.  When eating, eat slow and watch the sky change and all the New Yorkers.  It is a great night out.  All age friendly.  Pizza, salad and wings up the block was terrific!  Surf shop around the corner made us want to surf.   We would go back again to Jessica's and recommend it whole heartily.    Thanks for having us!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This appartment is pretty good for young visitors in NYC. Good things : working wifi, hot water, kings bed-very comfortable. Prize is pretty low. Bad things : apartment is very old, so bath is not nice its rusty on the bottom(but its working good). There is very noisy street, so you can listen to spanish music at night. We were confused where is the apartment, bcs there was different adress on airbnb. So we were looking for it for one hour in Bronx and this area is not so safe at night. Then landlord told me the true adress. In this aptm lives his father, he is very nice man, but his english is very bad. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The house itself was nice and very toasty, which I loved, especially with this cold weather. Rosa was there for us whenever we needed her and didn’t mind us coming in late due to it being New Years. The bed is super comfortable and we had our privacy. The location is actually pretty convenient. Its literally around the corner of a cvs, mcdonalds, spanish restaurants and the subway! The only bad thing was trying to find parking. Other than that, our stay was great.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location, charming (if a little funky) space.  Ronnie was a wonderful host -- very helpful and accommodating.  My only caveat would be that the mattress was very firm (which could be good or bad, depending upon your preference).</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Comfortable and very well located apartment. Ronnie really goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome. If music, art and books are your things and you enjoy experiencing the local scenery, then you cannot go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Best part about Ronnie's place is the location. It's handy to subways, busses, restaurants, Central Park. You can't go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>If you are on a budget like me, this is a great place to stay. The room is private, and right next to the entrance. I'm a VERY light-sleeper, and even with normal NYC street noise, I was able to sleep well. The bed is rather firm (I prefer a more medium-soft mattress), but not bad for a couple of nights. The location is amazing! Just a few blocks to central park, and a short walk to just about anything you could want to do. Ronnie is SO friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I stayed for one week at Yoni's place and, as my first Airbnb experience, it was as amazing as it could be. The apartment is VERY cozy and clean, the bedroom is absolutely perfect for a solo traveler, has lots of storage and it gets some great sunlight/fresh air. The location is fantastic, the neighborhood is safe and great to walk around and, less than two minutes from the building, there is a Subway station that gets you pretty much anywhere in the city. To top it all, Yoni is the perfect host. He made me feel at home as soon as I arrived and helped me with anything I needed. He literally knows everything there is to know about NYC and never hesitated on sharing his knowledge with me. I'd recommend this place to anyone that is planning their trip to NYC, you can't go wrong staying at Yoni's. Oh, and be prepared to fall in love with Oreo: he's the absolute cutest!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The hosts were very kind and helpful.  I loved the stay.  I was in the process of moving to NY and needed a temporary place to stay before I found me an apartment.  Everything was super clean and nice.  The neighborhood was not bad, there was good parking outside.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The apartment was small but ideal for a couple. It was great that it was conditioned with ac since those days in July were VERY hot. At a first glance, the neighborhood felt somewhat insecure at night since we arrived there at 2:00am but after a couple of days we realized we were wrong and the area was safe. We totally recommend this place for a couple who are looking for a place to stay in away from the city center. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place is a bad choice to stay. I am very disappointed. The good thing is the subway nearby and the host is easy to contact. All the rest are Terrible. The apartment is  vey old and dirty, small bed, bad smell. It likes I stay in 30 years ago in a very poor place. My headband install and tape up the old window air condition himself, the light is dark, place is noisy. Dirty cup in the room, all furniture are dirty and oily. The Toilet is old and dirty, no one clean every day, the bike are broken and never expect a breakfast. I mean, survive in this place is already hard. I should not believe the photo and previous reviews. The first day I arrive I would like to move out, but don't think about the host will refund u, once u pay, you have to stay in this poor place. I think this is only good for teenages groups who want to save money but don't want to sleep in a park. My room has 4 broken bed...the floor is full of others hair... My terrible experience!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Staying at Lenny's place was great. Check-in and out were all seamless. The kitchen, dining room and bathroom were all amazing. Location was great, close to the trains and lots of places to eat in the surrounding area. You have to prepare yourself for the walk up to the apartment on the 5th floor, but it's not too bad. I also didn't realize the bed was simply a mattress on the floor, but that's how it's depicted in the pictures so can't complain there. All in all it was a pleasant stay. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We walked in to find one of the rooms had two bad leaks in the ceiling with a garbage can and a bowl catching the water and a mop just sitting in the middle of the floor. Besides that, the place smelled like an old nursing home and was not clean. The fridge smelled bad, every surface looked quickly wiped down and not actually cleaned, there were crumbs and hair on the sheets that definitely were not washed before our stay, and one of the cupboards just had crumpled up napkins and paper towels stuffed into it. Airbnb ended up canceling our trip for us and comping us a room in a hotel that night and finding us another Airbnb for the remainder of our trip, which was more than accommodating. On top of that, the host was not helpful at all since he neglected to tell us about the ceiling in the first place and then, without apologizing, made the excuse that he had just learned about it that day (despite the fact it looked like it had been leaking for a while). It would’ve been okay had the place been cleaner and had the host seemed more apologetic and helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>accommodation was in a nice quiet neighbourhood and was in a good location beside many bus routes. The apartment was very clean and had comfortable beds and furniture. The main downfalls however was having no wifi and when on the app clicking the directions to the apartment brings you too the wrong place and found it difficult to get help from the host with this. The apartment itself is perfect for a quiet and affordable stay in New York with a nice location in Queens.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The apartment was exactly as described, and quite spacious for one person (especially by NY standards!). Izumi met me and easily explained the keys, laundry card, trash, and other logistics. She was flexible with meeting me as my flight into the city was delayed and changed several times. Upon leaving, I simply let her know my travel plans, and left the keys behind. This arrangement was perfect for someone who doesn't need much help with learning about the city, and can take care of themselves. We had minimal contact during the month of my stay, as there was nothing wrong with the apartment.  Cleaning materials were in the apartment, along with extra sheets and towels, and essential kitchen implements. This apartment is most convenient for those who want to be on the east side of town, taking advantage of the museums and shopping. It is convenient to several bus routes, but a bit further from the subway. Overall, it was a very lovely place to stay, with several convenience stores, grocery stores, and a variety of restaurants all within 1-2 blocks. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Maddy and her sister are very friendly and she give the most accurate and easy to use direction to her apartment. Helped me a lot with things I need to find in NYC ) The apartment itself is very nice, artistic, creative and cosy, full of light. The day-bad is in some kind of a niche, so I sleeping place felt private. I had my own copy of keys and I could plane the day as I want))\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My wife and I enjoyed our stay here. The private bedroom and bathroom made my wife’s first Airbnb experience great. The building is clean and secure with code required. The walk to the East Broadway (F) isn’t bad at all. We took public transport all the way to LGA (subway & bus) without issue. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het was een nette kamer met prima badkamer. De keuken hebben niet gebruikt, maar zag er ook netjes uit. De locatie was top, op loopafstand van one world trade center.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Great place to be in NY. Gabriel lives in the house but we almost didn't noticed him, he makes people fell that we are alone (in the good way). Every time we asked him something he was very accessible, giving some advices. The only \"\"bad\"\" thing is that there is no elevator in the building. :)\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I loved Brittany’s place! There is nothing bad to say about it. It was clean, well decorated with little trinkets and thrift store chic furniture (as well as cleverly arranged considering the small space). It had a nice ambiance. It’s comfortable. Brittany and her neighbors are very friendly. She was also very flexible and accommodating. The cast of characters you meet around the neighborhood are fun to have conversations with. You can find anything you need close by on close by Knickerbocker and there is a nice coffee shop/bookstore/bar across the street. It makes for a very Authentic New York experience.  Highly recommended. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Vi bookede i forvisning om, at vi var en familie på tre og havde brug for den fornødne plads.  Værelset levede på ingen måde op til at være et familieværelse med det resultat, at vores søn var nødsaget til at overnatte andet sted - vi finder Reeds udsagn om plads til tre meget misvisende. Af øvrige forhold kan nævnes beskidt badeværelse, håndklæder og sengelinned som ikke duftede rent - i det hele taget ikke et ophold vi kan anbefale til andre og derfor var der intet, vi kan sige, vi var \"\"vilde\"\" med. I øvrigt mødte vi aldrig værten selv !</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This room is fantastic and unbeatable for the price. A five to ten minute walk to Broadway and Times Square, ten minutes to Port Authority, you can't go wrong. So many great places around to eat as well, and the whole area has a fun vibe! There's a laundry across the road and the building has its own machines too which was very convenient. Room is just as pictured, surprisingly spacious for both NYC and the apartment. Linen and towels all fresh and the bed was SO COMFORTABLE! Great AC and closest space. As mentioned in previous reviews the bathroom and kitchen area could use some detailing work, but that didn't bother me. Hosts were quick and thorough in their communication, would definitely recommend or stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very comfortable bad in a decent size room.  Unfortunately the heater cannot be turned off but you can open the window!  Great location too in Manhattan.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Michelle was a great host. She communicated really well and clearly and helped us out along the way. The apartment is in an awesome location with a five minute walk to two Subway stations that can take you anywhere in the city. The bars and restaurants around the apartment are great. To be honest, it was a cheap stay so we weren't expecting the Four Seasons, but there was tons of cat hair on the bed, pillows, and floor. I didn't mind that there was a cat because that had been disclosed in the description and, quite frankly, it was one of the friendliest cats I had ever met. However, it made me concerned that the room hadn't been cleaned before we arrived due to the overwhelming amount of hair in the bedroom. Also, the shower was very dirty and the litter box in the bathroom made it smell very bad. The rest of the apartment, however, was pretty clean and there were no issues with mold, garbage, etc. </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Great location and easy to check in. The house has a big difference with photos. We lived there for 4 days, but we cannot use hot water in the first day and worse, there is no water second day. The washing machine was terrible and always full of someone’s clothes, sometimes even cannot work. In order not to bother upper floor guests, we accidentally closed the bathroom’s door and can not open again. We called the host and she was really rude and said a lot of duty words. But one thing is that we have paid service fee. I will not recommend others to live here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jovana en haar zus waren gastvrij. Wij mochten hun keuken, woonkamer, badkamer en onze slaapkamer gebruiken. Het is netjes en schoon. Het appartement is heel goed bereikbaar vanuit Manhattan; slecht een metrohalte vanaf Lexington avenue. De metro ligt aan de overkant van de straat evenals een supermarkt. Het is jammer dat Jovana en haar zus uit zichzelf geen tips geven. Zij zoeken weinig contact. Het appartement ligt op een kruispunt en er is tegen de ochtend veel geluid van verkeer. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Stayed two nights - we got in very late so I literally snuck in at 11:30pm but they had left the door to my room open and the light on so I wouldn't accidentally walk into the wrong room :) Apartment is typical older NYC so small bathroom and kitchen, my room was actually decent size, with a comfortable bed. Place was very clean. Bathroom very clean but of course small. I only met Jovana for a few seconds while she was making an early breakfast but she is very sweet and hospital. Be aware that this is a 4th floor walk up, which was not an issue for me but could be for others. Being LIC, there's much less traffic than Manhattan but also not a 24-hour restaurant on every corner (but one is within a 5-minute walk). Pro tip: She is right by the Court Square subway but take the E rather than the 7 if possible to reach her place, the underground walk from the 7 is several blocks.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Anthony deed geweldig zijn best om het ons zo comfortabel mogelijk te maken. Zijn appartement is ruim, voor oorlogs en bijzonder centraal gelegen. we hadden een ruime kamer met privé badkamer. uitstekend bed en een uitstekende douche.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Julie was very hospitable and accommodated my crazy work schedule - I changed arrival times a few times.  Since I was working and not on a vacation, I really appreciated the tranquil feel of her place, not to mention the beautiful surrounding neighborhood.  She helped me set up the room and we had an interesting conversation about the changes in the neighborhood.  She even had a bookshelf full of my favorite tomes- too bad I couldn't take the time to read any of them! The apartment is lovely,  as is the host.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wij zijn zeer tevreden van ons verblijf bij Gregory. De slaapkamer was zeer ruim en proper. Ook de badkamer was meer dan OK.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>In the beginning there was some trouble with the time of check in, this was a special occasion however because of Easter. Eventually we worked it out. The place is clean and in our opinion very well located near a big subwaystop and busy neighborhood. also Greg and Irene are friendly people. At first we were given a ‘wrong’ room because apparently it should not have been one with a private bathroom, so after 2 days we were sent to another room. Greg did apologized for the inconvenience. What really surprised us, was that we got a text late at night one time, if we could stop slamming the doors, what dissappointed us a little bit, because we ourselves had gotten woken up because of very loud guests who were also staying there. I didn’t get why we got the text, we really tried to be quiet, but because of this it felt a little bit like we had to tiptoe the rest of our stay. Also there was miscommunication about the shoes in the house, but as soon as we found it, we respected it of course . We liked the stay but I advise you that the house can sometimes feel crowded and like there isn’t a lot of privacy because you can hear other rooms quite well. Also the second room we got was far more noisy because it was towards the street and the bed was little less comfortable. But all with all we do recommend because of the location, clean, and helpful people who will gladly answer your questions. Also Cody is a fantastic cat.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Arash is a great host, with a clean place that is in a great location.  You can't go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I've never had a bad experience with Airbnb, but I've had a best experience: Patrizza's place in Park Slope was perfect. Her professionalism and hospitality were remarkable, the apartment was beautifully furnished and decorated, the location is right on Prospect Park, and the nearest station is less than five minutes walk from her door. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>In Bronx not bad~\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We had a great time at Tony's apartment, really good for big groups and enough room to relax after a busy day of sightseeing. Really close to Morgan Av station which is on the L and just 4 stops from Bedford Av which is ideal for exploring Williamsburg. The place was clean, an abundance of towels available and Tony's available if you need him. Would recommend if you are looking to experience a different part of the city in and outside of Manhattan. And of course its right across the street from Roberta's so you can't go wrong! Cheers Tony for a great stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We 5 people stayed for 2 nights. Actually everything is good except the location. It is a bit far from Time Square. Subway is very close, but maybe our expectation is too high since it is our first time to NY. We had a good time though. The store is very close and we cooked corn and eggs which is really helpful to our stomach. We are fed up with American food. Communication is the best point! So much bad experience in communication before this apartment.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Spacious apartment next to the DeKalb Avenue with many restaurants. The apartment is on the 3rd floor with no elevator, unfortunately the smell in front of the building and in the staircase was very bad everyday. Additionally the towels were not clean and we were only able to find sleep while wearing earplugs because of the noise from the neighbours and the street. The communication with Devin was very good and he even sent a friend to fix the windows on our first day.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a good time! It was a big studio with excellent kitchen appliances and a good bathroom. There's also an outside area but we didn't get to use it. Being on the ground floor made us a bit nervous about the safety, but everything was fine. Location wise there wasn't much to see in the area but it's about a 20-30 minute walk to Prospect Park, which is beautiful. Our only issue is the gate. One of us hurt our finger really bad closing the gate. There was a warning sign on it, but he didn't see it until he closed the gate on his finger. So that sucked. There were also major renovation going on upstairs and the workers would come everyday sharp at 8:45am and would get really loud. But that's only a temporary issue. Overall, we really like the place and would recommend it to people. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Felt like a home from home for the time we were there. Was a great base to explore the city, a few minutes walk from the subway. I appreciated the little folder that was left on places to go/eat/drink and the extra touches around the place. My gf was very happy with me for choosing this place. I (Hidden by Airbnb) d this neighborhood before I came to see what it was like and I would say ignore any of the bad things that have been said, NY is a big city so things happen, but I'd say it's a nice family area. But we weren't out late, so don't know what it's like at night. Had a brilliant holiday and recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I went to visit NYC with 2 other people. Mike was very helpful in making sure we would be comfortable staying at the apartment because it is a tight space. The space fit just right for us since we only were at the apartment to sleep, shower, and brush our teeth. =] The location of the apartment was perfect! The subway station is just across the street which made long days of walking not so bad. When we got to the apartment, everything was clean and ready for us. We walked into the apartment to find welcome notes and instructions which was awesome. Notes feel more personal and less robotic. Overall, we had a great stay. The area has a variety of restaurants and grocery markets near by. It was never crowded or loud. Felt like home.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Loved loved Loved Sarah's comfy cozy place!!!... Not a bad thing to say at all!!!.. She was fabulous about a later checkout time.. Clean cozy.. Electric.. Worldly decorations.. Excellent use of space... I absolutely loved it!!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Seth was a great communicator from pre-arrival through post departure. Our arrival time was delayed due to driving through bad weather and construction and Seth was very accommodating and waiting for us when we arrived.  His welcome, the apartment, the fresh sunflowers that he had left on the kitchen table, all were so perfect after a 16 hour drive.  The apartment is clean, comfortable, and even better looking than the images on air bnb. Seth had left us a pineapple and fresh bananas which we so appreciated our first morning. He made himself available by text but we still felt that our space was private and we could contact him if we needed something or not at all if we preferred. The neighborhood felt safe, the parking easy, and the public transit right around the corner. We would love to stay again on one of our future trips.  Thank you, Seth!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>For it being so close to time square and for the price I paid it wasn't bad. Place was clean and that's all I cared about. Not too shabby overall. There's parking down the street for about $60 a night but that's NYC for you. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed at Olivia's place for 10 days. We did not see her or her roommate in that time, so we got all the apartment to ourselves! But Olivia gave us 2 cell phones to communicate and she was available for questions. She also sent me a welcome e-mail with facts about the apartment, and suggestion about my stay in NYC. The room is just as the pictures show, and the whole apartment is beautiful. Only bad point for me personally, was that it is located over a busy avenue, and it was difficult for me to sleep sometimes (my boyfriend was OK), so if you are a light sleeper, I suggest you take ear plugs (I guess this happens a lot around NYC in general), and maybe a sleep mask also (lots of beautiful light in the room). I would definitely recommend Olivia's place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dette var et perfekt sted for vårt formål. Jeg og min sønn på 15 år hadde vår første tur til New York, og denne leiligheten var midt i blinken for oss. Stort, lyst loft, med et deilig bad og enkle kokemuligheter. Vi brukte både romaskinen og vektene til lit morgentrening, før vi gikk de to-tre minuttene til nærmeste t-bane som tok oss enkelt og greit til alle deler av N.Y.C. Veldig stille og rolig område, til tross for at det ligger svært sentralt i Harlem med massevis av tilbud i umiddelbar nærhet. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I had a great time staying with Funda.  The room is small but comfortable, the area is quiet, the wifi was strong, and the hospitality was wonderful.  You will not go wrong choosing to stay with Funda!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This room was so comfortable and reasonable. The room is nice size for a single tourist and the house is close to station, convenient store. I stayed here for about two weeks, but I didn't feel anything bad. Thank you, Funda.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice room, about fifteen minutes from metro. Not bad for such a price. You will share the bathroom and kitchen with the other guests. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room is small and tidy as in the picture, However the bad point was the heating system in the building is turned to the maximum degree and no control for the stove inside the room it was like burning I had to open the window to be able to breathe better.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This studio apartment was just perfect for my stay in NYC. This was my first airbnb experience and I was so lucky to have found Craig's place. I picked up the key at a nearby coffee shop where the first surprise was free coffee and a muffin courtesy of Craig, my host. He met me there and wanted to make sure I called him if I needed anything which I never had to because Craig pretty much thought of everything. He was so nice and gracious. The apartment was very comfortable, clean and  bright. Space where you need it.  Big desk area. Bed, pillows and couch were comfortable. The kitchen was well appointed with high end cookware. I especially appreciated the RH towels and artisan oatmeal soap in the bathroom. The studio is walking distance to supermarkets, restaurants, Union Square, farmer's market, and NYU. The L train subway is maybe 25 ft away or you can walk a few blocks to Union Square subway. Taxis and Uber are also readily available. The neighborhood is lively with a popular restaurant/bar on the corner and I felt comfortable walking alone at night in the area. FYI: It is a 5th floor walk up. I had a friend in town who wanted to come over but she has a bad knee and couldn't climb the stairs. No biggie, we just went to a restaurant. I just considered the stairs my personal Stairmaster! Lord knows I needed them after all the fabulous food we had. I will definitely rent Craig's place again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Craig's place was exactly as pictured -- comfortable, serene, in an amazing location, and with an immediate feeling of being at home.  Everything I needed was there and my stay was wonderful.  Craig was also a super helpful and communicative host, and very understanding when my flight was badly delayed and I didn't arrive until 2AM. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The studio was quite spacious and welcoming and the location is conveniently placed in a nice neighbourhood  with easy access to subway stations and supermarkets, and is a 3 minute walk to Union Square and Strand Bookstore. Craig made sure the apartment was clean and supplied with all the basic necessities and left all instructions necessary for us. Only slight issue was the 5 flights of stairs, which were great for exercise but bad when travelling with a lot of luggage. Overall, it was a great experience and stay, I recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient location and for anyone who doesn't mind some noise that comes from the nightlife surrounding the studio.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>the room was ok, but it smelled really bad throughout the apartment, so I would not recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was my first ever AirBnB stay and it was great. Michelle and Richard were extremely accommodating and easygoing and made my stay stress free. The subway is nearby and getting around is easy. Brooklyn is minutes away by train (I know because I got on going the wrong way). The room was plenty for me (I'm 6-5) and even though I was longer than the bed, I slept like a baby. I will definitely consider staying there in the future. Thanks again!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Michelle's home was excellent for what we wanted to do. Had a great time and stayed at an excellent place, can't go wrong staying here. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Being my first airbnb experience, I didnt know what to expect.  Ruth made me feel at ease right away.  What a generous and caring lady!  She really cares about her guests et treated us like we were part of her family.  Beautiful breakfast in the morning.  The room is exactly what is written on the add.  No bad surprises!  Private entry is a nice plus!  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location to access two subway stations at 135th street (both within a 5-10 minute walk).  The size of the apartment was perfect for three of us and plenty spacious.  A little bit noisy some nights but that may just have been bad luck.  Joy welcomed us and checked in with us throughout our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ruth is a very nice host and provides delicious, homemade breakfast daily. Place is convenient and parking is not bad consider it is Flushing. We enjoy our stay overall except bathroom gets very busy in the morning.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Room wasn’t to bad. The beds were squeaky and headboards weren’t attached but that is only problem we had with room. Parking is also limited.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The first thing to say is wow. I arrived at the building at around 7 pm and when I got up to the 5th (4th floor if you count ground level as seperate), which honestly whas a hastle but that was the only bad thing about the apartment and definitly not something that makes it bad.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Caroline is a good host - always replied to my emails even if some of it was more travel questions than accommodation enquiries.  The loft looked exactly like the pictures although most of the plants are dying - maybe she has been away for a while. The location was very wrong for us - but that is our own fault. I think it is early days for the Bronx as it is just to far away from the buzz of the city.  We did not feel save after 7 o'clock. We witnessed a shooting at the subway station and another 4 police activities at our front door.  I travelled with my 18 year old daughter and she did not enjoy the location.  We booked out earlier and moved to a hotel in the city - I already alarmed Caroline on day one that we want to move out but she could not give me any refund which is strange compared to hotel policies but she did state a strict cancellation policy on her profile.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Caroline’s place was super stylish! It was decorated beautifully in every corner and really gave off a New York vibe. Caroline provided us with a welcome book that had everything we needed to know about her apartment along with suggestions about where to eat in the area. She also left all sorts of brochures to various attractions. The neighborhood is fairly safe. It is right outside the bad neighborhood though so don’t wander too far off. The subway is only about a block away which isn’t too bad. The WiFi sucks when you connect to it with your cellphone but works perfectly fine on laptops. We had a lovely stay and we’ll definitely stay here again the next time we come back to New York!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jerome is very responsive and helpful, he will always answer your questions very quickly. The apartment has three rooms with no doors but it's spacious. The first room is Jerome's and we used the second and third room. The third room is the biggest with a closet. You have to walk two flights of stairs to get to our room. It wasn't too bad even with our luggage. The apartment is right next to the L train so it was very convenient for us. We fell in love with a restaurant/bar around the corner called Sweet Chick. There are plenty of bars and cafes nearby so no need to worry about where to go. The neighborhood is safe to walk around at night. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"A cautionary tale: If you're not familiar with Brooklyn, this neighborhood can scare you. If you're looking for 3 separate bedrooms, this apartment will disappoint you as they are all connected, and don't have individual access to the bathroom. If you need air conditioning and lights and tv, your power will go out.  We lost power twice. The host was not there, (his mother was, and she was soo sweet,) and the keys were not there when we arrived, so we waited on the front stoop for 20 minutes, inhaling the weed that was being smoked 2 stoops away. MORTIFIED. We couldn't get a hold of the host and waited dreading the thought that we had made a very bad choice. And by \"\"we\"\" I mean \"\"me.\"\" It was incredibly embarrassing. It smelled like a retirement home circa 1975 when you walked through the front door. It can all be summarized by the response when we asked where we could eat in the neighborhood</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I booked Raymond's home for my mothers 49th birthday slumber party. And Raymond's mom was amazing in helping my mother and her friends feel welcome. At one point we couldnt figure out how to get the sound on the tv working and she didnt hesitate to come help, and when she couldnt she got someone who could. She was very sweet and made us feel very welcome, as we as making sure we had more than enough towels and wash cloths. I also appreciate the early checkin I was able to do. It really made things convenient for us. Would definitely recommend staying here again, as well as for groups of 5 or 6. Just know if the weather is bad during your trip you will not be able to watch t.v, since it's a satellite. But it didnt bither my mom and friends 1 bit since we brought our own games.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bee is a great host. From the first day of commutation we had a positive impression of the host  which also influenced our decision to book this listing. This was our first visit to New York and we had lots of questions to ask, as we were looking for a specific location. All our questions were answered and we felt like we can trust to this listing. We had a very bad experience with one of airbnb listing previously but dealing with Bee was very pleasant experience. Listing was exactly the same as advertised. Apartment was very cleaning and tidy. there was everything we needed and we felt at home staying there.  Apartment is not big but excellent for two people. Definitely book this apartment next time. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time staying at Alfonso's place. Due to bad weather, we arrived in NYC later than expected and Alfonso still tried his best to accommodate us and help us with the luggage. The apartment was really clean and it looked exactly as the pictures. For 3 adults with lots of luggage, this apartment was comfortable for us. It also has a really nice location, 1-2 blocks from the subway and you can find everything around the block. If I ever visit NYC again, I would definitely stay at Alfonso's place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My host Anastasia was very welcoming, when I first arrived i was given an earlier flight and I text Anastasia letting her know that I would be there earlier then expected and she with no hesitation allowed me and my friends leave our luggages before our check in time.  The apartment was exactly what was shown on airbnb which everything was really nice and pleasant.  One of the bedrooms has the TV in it no TV in the second  bedroom or in the living room leaving my friends very disappointed because they felt it wasn't fair.  I was willing to give it up but they didn't like the bed in the room it was two low.  As for the kitchen we found ourselves not using it either we woke up late or left the apartment early to explore New York.  And my friends said they were not about to cook while there on vacation.  The subway was not that bad of a walk but for someone with problems walking (bad knees) it would be considered a long walk, then there are the stairs getting to the train with no elevator that is another thing that was an issue but my friend was a trooper but I was the one feeling bad, but all in all it was a nice place to stay away from all the touristy attractions and stay in a peaceful neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gilberto is a nice landlord, never made me feel uncomfortable. The room is big and there is Ac. The bathroom is clean as well. Nice neighborhood.Unfortunately the elevator stinks bad in the building. You can stay there no doubt</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Wonderful place! I really loved staying w Carmen. The room is exactly as the pic shows it. I went to NYC and thought it would be hard to get in and out of Bronx but I was totally wrong, the area is supported by two subway stations, bus and taxis... also you can take advantage of Uber, that works pretty like taxi.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Rossy was just excellent in responding to my messages and questions. I couldn't be any happier than this. Great place to stay and very safe and secure. Would highly recommended to anyone. You can't go wrong with this host. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Rossy and Juan were extremely nice! They helped me with my bags and told me where The closest subway stops were. All the information needed was displayed in the room, so I was never wondering about who I should talk to if something went wrong. There are other people who used the Airbnb at the same time (there were other rooms on the second floor) but I never had any problems using the bathroom. The water cooler is a godsend, especially after a long day in the July heat! This room is mostly private, and it has everything needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you guys!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Chad's apartment is just like the pictures. He keeps it very clean, and is very technologic (the alexa thing is amazing). It is just 2 blocks away from the train station and it takes you to times square in less than 15 min, and you have central park just 3 blocks away. Chad is the most amazing host ever, very helpful, funny and warm, we felt just like home. When we come back to NyC for sure we will check for chads apartment availability. You just cannot go wrong with this option :)</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The tub was so dirty you could run finger across it and make a stripe. The door frames in the bathroom were filthy.  When a centipede was on the pillow, we looked for it and behind the bed was so much junk, we of course, couldn't find it. Just unclean. It wasn't just dirty from a week before, it looked like it hadn't been really cleaned in a long time. There was no air conditioning as advertised.  It was so hot,  we had to keep the windows opened.  The first night it was ok because there was a breeze but after that, it was really hot.  And to make matters worse, the heat was on in the building.  She had two small 6 inch fans.  That's it. I never received the check-in information except for checkin was supposed to be at 3:00pm.  I called, emailed and left a message. The day before I was getting so worried I had to contact Airbnb and they, too, were concerned.  They said if they didn't contact her in 2 hours they would find us another place. Almost 2 hours later the host contacted me and said she worked and couldn't meet us until 630. This left us with even less time because we had to wait around until 630, then with the traffic it was more like 7.  It was a nightmare.She told us once we got there that they had closed the street for construction.  There was a lot of noise in the morning but the location is in a great spot.The apartment was great but with no air conditioning, it was not clean, and since the windows had to be opened, very noisy.  We paid alot of money for that location and it was a 2 bedroom.   It was not a good value.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A cosy New York home with lots of personality and exposed brick walls that allows you to live out your Carrie Bradshaw fantasies in the coolest Village location full of sweetheart cafes, heritage sites and badass boutiques. Lovely host who’ll have a cup of tea and give you great advice on things to do. A rare apartment on the ground floor, in a city of fourth-floor-walk-ups. Book with confidence if you want to feel like a real New Yorker.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Deze gezellige kelderwoning heeft alles wat je nodig hebt! Het ligt echt vlakbij de Q metro die je in een veertigtal minuten naar Midtown Manhattan brengt. Enkel voor vervoer van en naar JFK airport zal je een taxi nodig hebben. De ruimte zelf is groot genoeg en heeft echt alle (!) voorzieningen die je nodig hebt. Het enige minpuntje: in de badkamer kan het soms heel koud zijn... Jerry en zijn partner leken ons eerlijke, lieve mensen (we hebben ze slechts kort ontmoet). Kortom, niet twijfelen: gewoon boeken!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jerry’s place was very clean and comfortable and well equipped with everything you’d need for convenience and comfort. Communications were prompt and check in and checkout was extremely easy. I arrived in the middle of a snowstorm and was nervous about getting my suitcase to the entrance at night in bad conditions and Jerry immediately sent a photo of the well shoveled pathway and easy to find private entrance. Was very reassured by that gesture. Thanks Jerry and family for everything!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>When Barb & I arrived Elle welcomed us like we were old friends. She gave us a tour of our room & bath explaining all the amenities. She showed us the subway routes and schedules as well as the bus & boat schedules. If we were to have any problems or questions we were to call her and she would guide us. After having a bad experience at a airbnb in Manhattan last fall it was like we had entered a 4 star 4 diamond hotel. I would highly recommend Elle & Robs home to anyone who comes to the Big Apple.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room was clean, but it is small so it's perfect only if you want to stay one or two nights. It's good for anyone who wants to stay near the airport and the host,Jake,is really nice. The only bad part is that if you want to visit Manhattan like we did you need a lot of patience because it will take a long time to get there.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We ended up arriving around 6 AM and Jake was very accommodating. I felt bad because there wasn't a lock box with a key or anything, so we had to ring the doorbell and wake him up to get into our room. The room is tiny so my boyfriend and I could barely fit in the room together without getting claustrophobic and sweaty. My boyfriend is 6ft tall and his head was almost touching the ceiling making the whole place seem even more cramped. The location is still great if you need to catch a flight at JFK. Neighborhood seemed residential and nice.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jake was really helpful and gave us a ride from/to the airport for cheaper than a taxi. He is located not far from the airport. The room was small but clean. The sofa is small for tall people but for one night it was'nt that bad. (We just spend a night between two flights)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Really friendly people, apartment is located in great location. The house is nice but looks a little better on the pictures then in real life. Kitchen is good, bathroom a little old but neat. Bedroom is okay, only problem I really had with the place was the bed: small (length and width) and a pretty bad mattress. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was my second experience with Airbnb after a bad one, and a first in the US. What a relief ! The description was accurate, no bad surprises ! Tracy & Matt have been very friendly, welcoming and helpful during my stay, which made the experience really enjoyable ! The location is really convenient for a short stay in Manhattan, the subway is really close ! Definitely approved and recommended ! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Angelo was very responsive with our last minute booking and we appreciated him checking us in later in the evening. The apartment is located on a quiet street and is a fast trip into Manhattan. Keep in mind, that the confirmed booking address is not the actual address of the apartment - he messaged this after the booking, but we were referring to the AirBnB confirmation email and went to the wrong address.  Overall, it's a good value for the price, however the mattress is soft/sagging and we didn't sleep well.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>So after a long back and forth about my arrival time, I soon realized that he's so strict because his landlord doesn't know that he's using his spare rooms for AirBnb. He's a nice enough guy when you comply with his mile long list of rules, but not someone that should be hosting strangers in his home. Then after having a huge bug run across  my legs while in bed, I laid there wide awake all night to the sounds of that old squishy bed creaking with any sort of movement. I've never been more uncomfortable in a place. There are just bad vibes here. By all means stay here if you can't afford a hostel, but I probably would have slept better on the street.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>IT WAS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE TO STAY. The house location was not bad and cleaness was not bad. BUT he made us so strictly and when something happens he usually said to us even though we were not responsible for the occasion.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>About 5-10 min walk from the subway. Very convenient to go to various landmarks in NY. Not a bad stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I have never had such a bad stay as here.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A beautiful place to stay. We felt bad about our very late arrival due to a cancelled flight, and an early departure , but Kieran made us  feel very welcome. Our only regrets were that we didn't stay longer. Good coffee included!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Subpar for what we were looking for. The host did let me check in early but I never met him and his brother faraz gave me the keys. You have to pass through a hallway to get to the house and the inside area is in dissaray. The inside hallway door has duct tape on it. The inside courtyard is littered with garbage. The apt was smaller than expected from the pictures (which do a very optimal job of showing the place). The place smelled badly and in any case it was clear it wasn't being cleaned professionally. The host was kind enough to turn on the heat but there was no way to control it, they switched on the radiator. We had booked 2 nights and left after 1. Altogether I do not think this was worth the stay and would have preferred a hotel, for the price, which would have been similar or even cheaper.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Claire is a very good host. She was very flexible for the check-in (we arrived earlier than intended)  and made the check-out easy. I definitely recommend her place, there is enough room for a family and well situated. Too bad we didn't stay longer!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Myself and my friend are medical students travelling around America. Our first leg began in New York and we were extremely lucky to find a place hosted by two wonderful people in Velma and Stephen. The apartment was excellent with working wifi and directtv (although if you are watching TV at any point you are doing it wrong!). One of the rooms is much smaller than the other but ideal for a couple with a kid. Despite having reservations about the area, we had absolutely no troubles whatsoever and felt that we got a very authentic experience of living in a NY borough. We highly recommend the apartment to anyone looking to stay reasonably close to Manhattan, (there is a short 10-15min walk to the nearest station Nostrand/Fulton) about 25mins on the subway till you are in the heart of the city.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed here for 3 days and it wasnt bad at all I actually love the fact that theres everything you need is nearby and the host well shes just amazing and really helpful, if i ever visit New York again ima try to stay here again if possible.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>DO NOT PAY FOR THIS ROOM!!! It’s disgusting I was very disappointed spending $62! only to come to a freezing room with a dresser that was very difficult to open. It’s the winter i have a nerve disease you should’ve made it clear your HEAT DOES NOT WORK, The bathroom was disgusting hair toothpaste tooth brush everywhere, the tub was literally black filth that is completely unacceptable. Their lock box is very difficult to find because it’s like 10 other locks on that gate: i wish i could get a refund but since i can’t I’m telling u one on one. Al shouldn’t be so deceitful about the room. The bed was at a slant not even laying properly the pillows had NO pillowcases. And they were old and flat! That is NOT how you should do people. That’s wrong and you guys are very shady what a shame my very first time using Airbnb and i got a crappy room. Thanks for taking my money and nothing else... but hey happy holidays.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I will not be staying here again. There are major improvements that need to be made in regards to check-in, privacy, and communication. Once these are improved it would be a fine place to crash for the night. But definitely, not a stay. Check-in was horrendous because the host gave us the wrong keys. The co-host was a very kind man, but walked in our room a hour before check-out (pretty disrespectful bc there was no knock). The host himself was completely unresponsive in regards to the key situation. I’m disappointed from my stay, but made the most out of it with my friends. I hope this helps with your Airbnb search for a stay in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Rosa's place is in the heart of Greenpoint, just one block away from the Brooklyn Expo Center. It's a basic room in an older apartment building. If you just want a simple space that's not fancy and will spend most of your time out and about, you can't go wrong. Rosa is extremely nice and helpful. She told me about a wonderful Japanese restaurant (Zenkichi) and gave me advice about where to walk around Greenpoint and Williamsburg.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Maria was an absolute pleasure to stay with! Although away upon my arrival, her maid Carmen was there already waiting for me with keys eager to show me around. When we entered the apartment I was instantly wowed! The apartment was beautiful just as the pictures show. A gorgeous huge bedroom with a queen size bed, and such comfortable sheets. A huge full size mirror, large couch, and a tv were also many things included in the room. I instantly felt like I was at home. The bathroom was spectacular with the marble countertops, huge tub and it's such a plus you have your own bathroom! Also upon arrival I was given clean, new bath towels. After Carmen showed me a tour of the building, I couldn't wait to spend my summer living in NYC! The 24hr doorman and concierge are a huge plus. I can't even explain how helpful they were with not only directions and restaurant recommendations, but also how friendly and sweet they were. Everyday leaving and entering the building I was always greeted by name. Maria was an absolute sweetheart when I met her. She was so genuine and friendly and was eager to show me around! She was so sweet, amazing, and accommodating during my stay I couldn't have asked for anyone better to stay with. She told me what was around the building (the YMCA flagship is located right next door, with a New York Sports club a block away!) and always left me little notes telling me where the nearest grocery store was to check out, or where to get local goods from the farmers market. There is also a citi bike station located right outside the building! The view from the window is spectacular. You go to sleep every night with the city lights and a clear view of the Chrysler building, and wake up to a beautiful sky line. The apartment is also located a very short walk from grand central, from which you can get anywhere! Did I mention there is a laundry room located INSIDE the building?! Talk about convenient! Never having to lug your dirty laundry out around the city was a major plus during my two month stay. Overall Maria was an absolute joy to stay with and I wish I could've stayed longer with her in her beautiful apartment! You can't go wrong with booking her amazing place. Not only do you get your own room and bathroom with amazing views, but such a friendly, spectacular host to go along with it. I will definitely book with Maria in the future if I go back to NYC. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het appartement is ruim en licht en biedt voor 6 personen prima ruimte. De bedden zijn prima en de slaapkamers zijn ruim. De badkamer is goed en handig ingericht.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Highly recommend! Joseph was a perfect hosting - very accommodating. He was always easy to reach and checked on my comfort and needs - not too much but just enough so I knew I could count on him should something have gone wrong. His Studio is amazing;  very high end, clean, spacious and the location can't be beat.  I would definitely stay at Joseph's studio again when I return next to NYC.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lovely, cute apartment in a great area - perfect for a short stay in NYC. Unfortunately I had to cut visit short due to bad weather in the city but Kaitlyn was incredibly understanding. Would have liked to spend a little longer but maybe next time! Very good experience, communication wouldn't hesitate to book again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Et lille værelse i West Village nær et pulserende byliv. Tæt på subway og butikker i SOHO. Værelset er småt og man skal kunne acceptere bad i køkken og toilet på gangen. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Molly's place was as advertised - clean and true to the pictures shown on Airbnb. However, the afternoon of my arrival, I was unable to enter the premises as agreed upon due to construction obstruction. I thought I was in the wrong place due to the amount of workers and equipment in front of the house. I called Molly who promptly contacted her husband to help clear the entrance to the apartment (garden/basement).  A short while after I was allowed entrance, heavy overhead construction noise was unbearable forcing me to vacate the premises. I was told by Molly that the construction was unexpected and would be done by end of day. The following morning, construction workers were on-site without the host to greet them. After much knocking on the window of what was my bedroom, I contacted Molly to advise. I vacated the apartment most of the second day due to construction noise. Upon my arrival early evening of day two at Molly's, construction equipment was blocking the entrance to apartment - this required my speaking to one of the workers to have him allow for access for me to enter and exit while storing of equipment. I again asked Molly if construction would continue on day three, given the obvious, and I did not hear back until late in the evening, because she was entertaining. Construction, directly overhead, continued onto my third morning at Molly's. Regardless of my attempts to have Molly find a solution or confirm a real end to the disruption that rendered the apartment uninhabitable, we didn't reach a resolution until I contacted Airbnb. The apartment is lovely but during construction, it is not appropriate for renting, as was the case with me. The insulation between floors also needs consideration, particularly when entertaining directly above the rental space. Otherwise, they were lovely.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Molly was very professional and despite me trying to get into the wrong house at first it was still a great experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I liked the hosts! Very nice and welcoming people! Yolanda is kind and helpful woman and her husband too! The room is ok, two comfortable to sleep on beds. Room was clean but it's rather dark and doesn't seem cosy for me, but my younger brother was totally fine with it. It is also close to the train and JFK! Overall not bad and thanx for the breakfast to Yolanda!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td> Marjorie accepted us on somewhat short notice after another host had to cancel on us, she was a life saver. My friend and I were there for a concert and sightseeing so we spent very little time in the apartment. The guest room is at the front of the apartment with a hall door dividing it from the rest of the apartment. We saw very little of our host, had lots of privacy, didn't even hear her moving around when we were there, too bad we didn't have more time to hang around and get to know each other, she seems like the type of person that has loads of interesting stories.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A lovely home hosted by a lovely person! You will find extra perks (stocked fridge), lots of linens, candy and more! Absolutely nothing bad about Anna’s place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Really enjoyed my stay at Claude's place, such a convenient location. I stayed with a friend and while this was my first Airbnb experience that was not the case for my friend. He had some bad experiences with previous hosts and his encounters made me a bit uneasy. Luckily we had an awesome host, even my friend was satisfied! Starting with check in which was timely, the room and restroom was clean, the bed was comfortable and so were the sheets. Communication was great throughout my stay, most was done through text and his responses to my few questions were quick. Lastly, we appreciated his generosity with accommodating our luggages for a while even after we had checked out. Really helped me venture out into the city a bit longer without the hassle of carrying my bags all over the place. Next time I'm in the city will definitely look out for Claude's listing.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>What a great experience!! Can’t say one bad thing about Claude and my stay. My family and friends were concerned about me staying in someone’s apartment in the city. I couldn’t have felt any more safe! The hospitality and small touches were an extra bonus! Will be back!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice place and a comfortable stay! Mariano is super friendly and accommodating. Great location and easy to get around. The bedroom was plenty big for one person. The room was a bit chilly some nights, but according to locals, I was visiting during some atypically bad weather, so I don't imagine this is a problem most times. Also, the shower was nice and hot to make up for it :) Overall I was completely satisfied with my visit and would recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Staying with Brent was excellent. The neighborhood is in a great location, the rooms are clean, the bathroom is spotless, and even the fifth floor walk up isn't bad. Brent was always around if I needed directions or help with anything. I was very comfortable and so were my two friends that also stayed there with me. It was a great experience and I would recommend it! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Brent's apartment is a few blocks from a subway station and the 5 flights aren't too bad after the first couple trips.  He is a really laid back host - there to help with recommendations and answer any questions.  The apartment is clean, and the room has its own AC (THANKFUL).  He has a pretty badass dog too</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Allie's apartment is clean, bright, modern, beautifully decorated, and PERFECT for a city weekend away. My girlfriends and I stayed here in April 2017 and could not have found a better spot. Coffee shops, restaurants, Union Square, shopping, subway, everything you need right at your doorstep. There is a parking garage directly underneath the building, it was about $42 for us to park there for about 36 hours – not bad!! The description of the apartment is completely accurate: 1 bedroom, 1 bed, couch, and 1 deluxe airbed, clean stocked kitchen, large dining area, and a super fancy waterfall shower in the bathroom. I was surprised at how spacious this place is! We would absolutely stay again.\n</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Although Frederico was a nice guy (we didn't meet). My experience was a bit worse than I expacted.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I dont have any bad word about Alesandra's apt and its location. You can get anywhere by taking a subway which is far by walking 3-5 minutes. Although I never meet Alesandra, she was always helpful and nice :) ... If I have a trip to NY I will choose Alesandra, again and hopefully I will meet her personally :) </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was very positive. Everything was as Alesandra advertised. The apartment was clean and the neighborhood felt safe. I never actually saw Alesandra because our schedules didn't align, but she checked up on us frequently and was very responsive if we had a question or needed anything. There were 2 of us and the bedroom was pretty cramped for 2 people but since all you have to do is sleep there, it isn't bad. I had the \"\"extra\"\" bed and have slept on better</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It's our first time in NYC, we stayed for 6nights this airb&b, Alensandra is very nice and friendly, she try to provide us whatever we asked for such as towels, hair hair dryer and so on. Overall the stay was great and simple! The location was not bad, it's quite quiet and safe, subway is just 4min walk away to travel to downtown. Central Park about 20min walk, Supermarket, 7eleven is just nearby (1-2min walk), cafe and fast food was behind the apartment (3-5min walk). I would say it's quite value for money and we quite enjoy the stay. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Alesandra's place was nice and the location was good but we did not feel very welcome. Maybe we caught her at a bad time.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wonderful experience. Alesandra was very communicative and friendly, the apartment was clean and comfortable. There is some street noise, but I was able to sleep without a problem with the window partially opened, so it's not too bad. Great place. Great location.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Well, location and price were good. I also appreciate the good communication and check ins from time to time. These are table stakes. I guess we got what we paid for. I am by no means a clean freak but I expect a relatively clean home to stay at if someone is putting their place on Airbnb. Here are my complaints: We got bit by mosquitos several times during the nights. The pillows were in awful condition -- flat as a piece of cardboard. There were used towels already hanging in the bathroom. Tub was kinda gross. We put water bottles in the fridge to keep cool, but a bad food odor was building up. Aside from the location, we were trying to be in the unit as little as possible. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Não poderia encontrar um lugar melhor para ficar em NYC. O apartamento é exatamente como as fotos, extremamente limpo e cheiroso. Dava pra perceber que as roupas de cama e de banho tinham acabado de ser trocadas. Além disso, o prédio tem elevador, o que ajuda muito se vc for fazer comprar e tiver que descer e subir com uma mala pesada. Uma coisa que não é mostrada nas fotos: quão maravilhosa é a Grace. Como anfitriã ela foi super gentil, solicita e fez mais do que o necessário para nos fazer sentir em casa. Alguns dias eu preferia ficar em casa conversando com ela do que sair pra rua. O quarto acomoda duas pessoas tranquilamente. O apartamento fica a 2 quadras do Subway e em menos de 15 minutos você está na Times Square. Além de ser super perto do Central Park também (5 minutos andando). Enfim, não pensaria duas vezes antes de ficar aqui de novo. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was exactly as described. Nothing bad to say about this airbnb experience, hips of space for all of us, easy parking on the street, easy communication with Ben, well equiped apartment, large outdoor area (will be great in summer when ready), industrial but great and safe neighbourhood (love it!)... A very nice place to stay and visit Brooklyn. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time staying here.  Perfect space for the four of us.  The kids really loved the apartment. I honestly thought the noise was going to be louder from what I read on previous reviews, etc, but it wasn’t all that bad.  Front bed was super comfy, kids slept in the back room bed and they slept in most days.  Train was just around the corner which was nice, R train had construction on the return from the city, so it put a damper on our anticipated direct return to the apartment.  Showers were hot, linens were fresh.  We had a nice welcome pack of juice, soda water (our kids’ fav), and some beer.  Sad to say we missed meeting Stephanie and Dawn, they were out of town. However, super prompt with the responses to our inquiries. AC was on the fritz, a bit warm as the weather got hotter than expected but we made due. We will definitely consider this property again for our annual Memorial Day visit. Thanks ladies. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place to stay in NYC. Very clean and Kate and her family are amazing. They allow you to have as much privacy as you wish. Quick to answer questions and were attentive to our requests. Takes about an hour to reach Manhattan which isn’t too bad. Only con is in the summer it can be quite hot as there is no A/C. However, we were provided with a box fan. Once again, if you visit NYC, I greatly recommend staying with Kate and her family!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wat een heerlijk appartement! Fijne bedden, prettige living, complete keuken en badkamer, echt een 'home away from home'. Josandra en John zijn heel gastvrij en heel attent. Metrolijnen zijn op prima loopafstand  en supermarktjes zijn ook maar een paar blokken verderop. Wij zijn fan!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We arrived a day early because I got my dates wrong. Christy was gracious enough to help us find another great Airbnb within walking distance in the neighborhood. Once we got to Christy's apartment, we felt at home. It is spotlessly clean, bright, and modern--just like in the photos. We appreciated having a separate bedroom so that my son and I could each have our own spaces. The YMCA at the end of the block has a good fitness center that allowed us to get our morning workouts in. This was a great choice for our stay in New York, and I would choose it again.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td> Chistys lejlighed var helt perfekt til vires lille ophold i Brooklyn. Vi har prøvet andre lejligheder i Brooklyn og på Manhattan men den her er klart den bedste vi har prøvet. god beliggenhed, dejligt badeværelse, godt køkken, god sovesofa. alt var rigtig fint og til en rigtig god pris. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was our first Airbnb experience and we really enjoyed it. My wife and me were accompanied by our two kids 10 and 12 and the apartment has ample space. We were out each day so really only used the apartment at night and in morning. The Netflix on the tvs were good for the kids to chill out with at night and the wifi was excellent.  The apartment was very clean when we moved in and the air conditioners in the bedroom and living room were bliss as it was very warm when we visited (mid July). The key to this apartment is the great location, 5 minute walk to the subway and even novices like us navigated the trains with ease into Manhattan each day (stick to a and c trains and you can’t go wrong).There are good shops on the corner where you can grab all your essentials plus good pizza shop and liquor stores nearby. We found the street pretty quiet and even the fire station across the road is not a issue. Kitchen in apartment is handy for breakfast and we cooked dinner most nights as we were tired of eating out. The suburb overall we found to be good and we felt quite safe walking around and had no issues. Would thoroughly recommend this apartment and happy to stay there again. We never met Christy but she was very responsive by email on the air bnb site and there was ample information provided in the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Christy’s place is a comfy pad on a quiet block in BedStuy. Close to groceries (1 block), eateries (try Bedford Manor 2 blocks away!) and subway. There is a firehouse a few blocks away, so we did hear some sirens, but that’s NYC and it really wasn’t bad or too often. Everything worked great at Christy’s; both beds are comfy, the air conditioning was such a blessing (90 degrees on our second day in town! In October!) and the bathroom is gorgeous with a nice, deep tub. We loved having the balcony to sit w/coffee in the morning and see the moon at night. Didn’t hear neighbors, very clean and comfy place, we’ll be back!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Affordable and great place to stay when you're visiting NYC. Upon arrival the door was closed and Kendall not at her place. Most likely this was just bad luck. She handled it well (arrived within the hour).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kendall's place is like staying at the home of your artistic friend or relative who's always had way better taste in decorating than you. The apartment is very well styled, though the furniture is perhaps a bit more worn than the pictures suggest. One surprise we had was how small the bed was in the second room. It's maybe a small full or twin XL, which meant (for our party of four) that one couple had a quite spacious bed and the other were very tightly packed. Not too bad for us, but I could imagine it not being so comfortable in hotter weather and/or with larger bodies. The building and neighborhood are on the rough side, but we knew what to expect (at least regarding the neighborhood) going in. Not much in the way of amenities nearby, so plan to do a bit of walking for any food, beverage, or other needs. The 2 train is a short walk away, with the Q station about 15-20 minutes out should you need it. Kendall was very responsive to our questions and concerns via text, we did not meet in person.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was a pretty bad experience. Although it seems like a good deal, it's way worse than what you pay for for it. First, the rules say you can't smoke, however they smoke in the room, which may not bother some people, but it bothered me. Also, I was not able to shower one of the nights I was there because the water was turned off, as well as the wifi. The people living in the apartment were always loud when they were there, so it was difficult to sleep at night or sleep in after nine, but if you wake up early, it wouldn't be a problem. You can definitely tell it is the quality for which you pay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Michael was really a terrific host and I'd be happy to stay in this or another of his properties. I got to see and talk with him several times as he was working on the place and on other tenants' spaces, and it was clear that he really cared about his clients' happiness with the accommodations, and that attitude is very much appreciated. The apartment itself was fine. It is in a very old building and everything creaks and has had a lot of use. It was on the fifth and top floor of a walkup, and the stairs were not as bad as I had anticipated. He told me at check in about the windows being bad and they were: the doublepane seal is compromised so they were essentially foggy and unwashable to lose the fog, and the left hand upper one above the air conditioner would slip down and the right hand lower one wouldn't close, leaving a 1/4\"\" gap at the bottom. But pushing the left one up and putting some plastic bags in the right one basically solved those problems. He says he will replace the windows and I don't doubt he will</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ten minute walk to the ferry but we preferred to uber back at night due to the neighborhood. Suited our needs for our first time visit to New York and first time using air bnb for accommodations. Oswaldo was a good communicator and responded quickly. No issues with self check-in.  Couch and love seat in living room were not very clean and had a bad odor and probably need to be replaced. Wifi worked well. Parking on the street was free but quite limited and people parked close together. Updated kitchen was nice. Access to washer and dryer in basement. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Highly recommend, very close to public transportation and William is a great host. Cannot go wrong if his space fits your needs.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Good location, a little loud but not too bad. We stayed here with a group that included a toddler and he was able to sleep through the night. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay at this Airbnb was supposed to include two bathrooms for use. Unfortunately one of the bathrooms had a horrible odor. We were told it was a plumbing issue that rarely happened and were just given some air fresheners. This did not help at all. The sewage stench overpowered any sort of air fresheners used. They told us there was nothing else they could do and left it at that. With this said, we paid for two bathrooms and were really just using one toilet for 6 people. Overall the location was good. It was a bit of a walk to the closest subway. It was a walkable distance to restaurants and night life though. It does get very loud late night from the bar across the street and early mornings from the honking traffic and construction. Walls felt very thin considering we could hear other people in their rooms. When someone was opening their front door it sounded as if they were opening ours. There were three bedrooms which were good. Beds were okay. It would be nice to have had mirrors in each room for the sake of three girls getting ready with one bathroom out of the option. There was a washing machine and dryer and they provided us with detergent. The place didn't quite feel the cleanest. As soon as we got there we had to move the rug out of the way because of how dusty it was. They also had a TV there but it only had one channel and didn't work. The place itself is very small but the 6 of us made it work. It's a good value for a place in New York trying to house 6 people. We were mostly sold on the two bathrooms and price point. It's too bad there were plumbing issues. I don't think we'd come back to this location. We would probably pay more next time for another Airbnb that's cleaner and closer to a subway station. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great central location, very accessible hosts. Make sure you double check the street address with the hosts because we ended up being sent to an area about a block away and had no idea we were in the wrong place. Not a quiet part of town but certainly lots to do, especially at night. As many other reviewers noted, you have to be ok with a good amount of nighttime noise. We discovered an awesome rooftop garden with spectacular views of the city! Closest subway stop is the L on 3rd Ave.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Awesome place to stay! Location is great -- near 3 different train stations and very close to Manhattan. The only bad thing is the construction in the neighborhood, which we had expected based on previous reviews. I was able to sleep through it so it wasn't a huge problem. Pets are super chill; Sati is such a cutie but shes super shy so we played with the sweet cats instead. Staying here has been an awesome experience and the hosts are both extremely friendly and cool! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Kara and Edward's place is exactly as described, with a a comfortable room and easy access to public transport. They were warm and welcoming hosts — pets included! — and you can't go wrong staying with them on your trip to New York.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We have stayed in this place with my family and in general it was a good experience. What we liked: 1. Nice and clean building 2. Great spacious apartments 3. Friendly and helpful supervisor 4. Nice location if you are looking for a place in Greenpoint. But commute to Manhattan is not very comfortable 5. Laundry in the building What we didn't like: 1. Noise. Windows don't protect from the noises at all. Right near the building someone has been making live concerts every weekend, trucks were passing by every night. If you are sensitive to the noise - you better ask an apartment that is not facing the street (may be this helps) 2. Weird management. We asked the management to extend our lease for another month. There might have been a miscommunication about when we should pay for the extension but anyway I think it is simply unacceptable not to let your client know that you've leased the apartment to another person. Especially if you know that your client has a 2y.o. baby and the offer for extension is active (!) on Airbnb. We found out that we can't extend the deal 3 days before the move out date (although Airbnb extension offer was still active!). That was a crazy experience but we've managed to find another place. 3. Smell and flys. Garbage bins were right near our window and therefore we had all the bad smell and dozens of flys. But in general I think it was an ok place</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Einar's apartment is very comfy, bright and well equipped. Also in a terrific location, some street noise, but not bad. We received a helpful introduction to the apartment and the neighborhood, with many good suggestions for restaurants.  It was clear we could contact Einar for advice and help should we need it. I would highly recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment has absolutely everything, it was better than what we expected. The location is very close to Manhattan and the train station just a couple of blocks away. Ben makes sure you have everything you might need already there at hand (even museum cards). The only bad thing was that the entrance key  of the building changed by the week we arrived and we only had one key for the buildings main door. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Chester is a really nice, helpful fellow, the flat was perfect (clean, comforable). The only bad thing was the neighbours - sometime they were too noisy.  But Chester's apartment was a good choice.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Clean place looks exactly like pictures, didn’t bother us and gave fairly quick responses , Enjoyed our place and didn’t have to bad of a time finding parking. Would return</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is in a nice location. I was there for 2 nights but hardly spent time there. The apartment itself is really nice but this room is extremely small, and I had very bad reception in the room so if you are here on business this could potentially be a problem for you if you need to make calls from the apartment. Overall I had a nice stay, and would come back.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>both fred and crystal were very nice host, they were very welcoming when i finally got to their lovely home late, i felt bad because i had a late flight.  they get me situated right away so i can quickly get ready for bed. the room was really clean and open and with two huge windows with great views cause the room is sitting on the corner of the street, the room like this is hard to come by in nyc.. the sheets were super soft and the bed were very comfortable, i slept like a baby.. oh and the neighborhood was really quiet and super convenience as they are a citibike dock just right there and subway stations C just behind the corner, all within a minute walk, and G train is just a few mins walk, and just 4 stations away from lower manhattan! there are a few corner grocery stores just down the streets, more reasons to love this place, amazing!! i would definitely come stay with fred and crystal next I'm in town, i hope they have opening next time I'm in town as you have to just jump on it when you see openings cause it gets booked quick! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time at Marcus's place, which we chose largely for the location, near the Metro J line with a direct connection to Times Square.  The check-in with Marcus's nephew Abado was perfect and both he and Marcus were very responsive to our needs.  In particular, we loved the extensive cable TV system with several premium channels and Netflix (it is a bit complicated but Marcus showed us how it works--we totally recommend his tutorial).  After 2 previous experiences climbing 2 and 4 flights of stairs it was also nice to be on the second floor just one flight up.  The apartment is very spacious, the bed is comfortable, the bath is fine, the kitchen is nicely equipped, and we found it convenient to have the TV in the living room.  We also liked the area.  We shopped for food at Mr. Kiwi and enjoyed eating at several nearby restaurants/cafes.  Some previous guests have recommended Little Skips cafe, which is unfortunately now closed but lives on in a smaller version as Baby Skips, which is right next to Little Mo, which we liked, and we can also recommend The Leaf across the street from Little Mo.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We hebben een heerlijk verblijf gehad bij Sarah. We zijn hartelijk ontvangen door haar. De foto's bij de advertentie geven goed weer hoe het appartement er uitziet, mooie badkamer, nette slaapkamer en allemaal erg schoon. Daarnaast is de stad gewoon fantastisch! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great value in terms of space and furnishings for rental rate. Very responsive hosts, easy check in. Bathroom and kitchen were super clean. Property is practical for a family. Kitchen had all you need for a short vacation, including a dishwasher which is a luxury in NY.  Our 3 kids (14, 12, 10) fit fine in the second bedroom - they thought the beds were a bit hard but they’re kids (they don’t have bad backs) and it totally worked. Walls are thin. We heard neighbors clearly and it made us very conscience of making any noise ourselves. That might just be NY living. No in unit laundry. There was a laundry room downstairs. We didn’t check it out, not sure if you just need coins or some kind of value card to use it. We didn’t need it. Not sure how hosts split their time in the unit versus letting it out but all of the storage areas contained their things, so you wont be able to unpack really but it was fine for our needs. Neighborhood was very safe. Sort of a “master planned” community. Lyfts were easy to get. If the L train is down, then accessing the subway in this part of town is a pain, so look out for that if you’re doing a lot of commuting around the island.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Zoe was a great host; very responsive and courteous. The apartment is within a few minutes walk to the nearest metro. To note, the apartment is on the second floor with no lift if that is a concern for some. Restaurants and shops are all around. Parking is not so bad though I suggest using one of the local garages of you do bring a vehicle. The apartment has the basic necessities. We were very comfortable. I would definitely stay again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I've stayed at multiple Airbnbs before and I've always enjoyed my stays and have never had any bad things to say about my hosts or their apartments. Hans was nice when I met him in person and the apartment view is beautiful. However, I had a very scary incident in which I got locked in the bathroom with no one home. The lock became faulty and I was stuck inside for almost an hour, with no window, no ventilation and a high temperature due to the mid summer humidity and lack of air conditioning in the bathroom. It turned out that the lock was faulty and was replaced thereafter. This was a very scary incident for me. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Place was nice, close to the train 45min to Manhattan, so that wasn’t bad. We were able to find parking for our van so that was great. About a 20 uber to Williamsburg. So all in all A+ spot</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Victor was a fantastic host for my girlfriend and I's first Airbnb experience. He went above and beyond and took time away from his already planned scheduled haircut to meet us near the subway station by his house so he could walk with us through the neighborhood to his home. Additionally, he made flexible arrangements with us to have us check-in immediately when we arrived into New York (which was around noon and way before 3pm as Air bnb suggests). The neighborhood in the daytime is very uplifting and diverse with many markets in the area. The subway station is as Victor described about 10 minutes walking to each station nearby and 20 minute ride into the city. I would suggest walking with a buddy at night though as it does make you feel a bit uneasy when it gets dark to walk there alone, but Victor definitely was good about reassuring that nothing goes wrong even after hours. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Victor was a very good host, he answered all the question I ask and made our stay as pleasant as possible. House was clean, room was spacious. I have nothing bad to say about Victor's place.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>With Victor’s kind heart, you will never be afraid of New York’s worse car parking situation. And he definitely is good at impossible tasks for parking. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Amazing experience in this apartment. Will try to stay here again on my next trip. Everything about this place, it was quiet in cozy and in a very good neighbourhood. Metro, restaurants and shopping all within walking distance. The apt was as it appeared in the pictures and met description. Comfortable bed, wifi and AC, can't go wrong! I had to message Sara a few times and she always responded to my questions quickly. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Huset var veldig sjarmerende, med 2 fulle etasjer med bad og 2 soverom i hver etasje.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed at Lynn’s Staten Island home over the Thanksgiving holiday and it was nothing short of wonderful! Lynn was extremely accommodating and showed incredible hospitality. We came to NYC for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and Lynn was able to give us a lot of advice about navigating the city that morning and day. We were welcomed by a bottle of wine and cheese/crackers. The wine was much appreciated after our somewhat stressful commute into and around the city the night of our arrival. Her home was impeccably clean and very spacious. It was in a residential neighborhood at the end of a quiet cal-da-sac which was great for unpacking/packing the cars. There is no driveway but we were able to find parking spaces to park our cars no more than one block away and we kept them there our entire stay with no problems. We felt very safe walking around at all times of the day (super early the morning of the parade and really late at night after a full day in the city). The ferry terminal is only a 10-15 min walk and really wasn’t bad at all.  We had 2 kids with us (6 and 8) and they handled the walk each day very well! We had events planned in the city every day and the added time on the ferry back and forth was not bad at all. Thanks again Lynn!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Wonderful, quintessential New York Loft in a great Chelsea location. Huge and loaded with charm, you can't go wrong with this rental.  A Whole Foods on the corner and everything else you need within a few blocks.  Highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We can't praise this place or our host more. A large light, airy space fully equipped and in the perfect location in Chelsea, near everything you need and want, including restaurants, clubs, the Joyce Theater, the Jazz Record Center, and Fashion Institute of Technology and FIT museum. We probably should give this place a bad review so we can keep it to ourselves, but it really is the perfect place to stay in New York, especially if you are an arts maven.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Carol is a great host, there were breakfast options stocked such as bagels (excellent!) , juice, milk etc including drinking water. She was also very nice to bring us out to direct us to the nearest public transportation =). Though the apartment was quite chilly at first, after letting Carol know she immediately rectified the heating within a day. Except for the location (takes about an hr to get to times square by subway), this is not a bad place to stay especially if you have 4 pax travelling together.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The rooms were ok the neighborhood not that good is bit far from time square. The big bed was really bad very uncomfortable to sleep the air conditioner it's a fan doesn't work very well and it get hot in the rooms. Overall she's very nice(the lady) but I wouldn't book this place again if I go to New York</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I would recommend to people as long as they don't have dust allergies and don't mind a sub par clean place. The layout is fantastic with lots of room. Awesome balcony facing a lovely garden. Excellent Forte Greene location. Host was rude and grumpy when we asked the night before leaving if we could have a late checkout. Also rude about us using his espresso coffee all up when he said help yourself to anything. Didn't have time to replace the day of leaving since he refused a late checkout. Kind of gave us a bad feeling at the end of a fantastic trip.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lital & Eyal were super nice and welcoming. Hotel rooms are like hamburgers. Some good. Some bad. But they are all more or less the same. This place is like a Cobb salad made from ingredients from 5 countries you never heard of. Amazing and super unique. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Cost benefit wise its also a good match. Short walk to the subway to Manhattan, to local store, great pizzeria and a diner. If you are into bars then there seems to be plenty of those 10min walk away. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice location and responsive hosts, but the apartment is in bad shape.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed for only one night but definitely had a delighted stay at Gina's place! Gina is a wonderful and easygoing host, her room is neat, clean and spacious, bigger than what it looked like on the photos. Her apartment is near to the subway, hence it's convenient to travel around. Too bad we got to run for our bus on our last day, if not I'd definitely want to chat with her more! Highly recommending her apartment to all other travelers!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perhaps it was my mistake, but I expected something cleaner and nicer from the listing. It was a very tiny studio, with the smallest kitchen I've ever seen. It wasn't exactly dirty, but there were dirty towels in the hampers and it had a strong scent of some type of perfume or air freshener. It is on the ground floor, meaning you can't open the blinds or you're very visible. The windows also don't open in front. Everything just felt shabby. The entryway and hallway outside the apartment are filthy. Probably the worst part was the roaches everywhere. Now, I've lived in Harlem so I know this type of apartment well, I just didn't really think it would be like this from the listing. Somehow I expected something clean and recently updated/in good repair. I'm not sure if that's my mistake but you should be aware. Now, Gina we perfectly friendly and communicative so I feel bad but this is the true state of the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great small studio for two. The neighborhood is not bad and is very close to Columbia university. The only problem I had was that there would that the apartment was right next to the entry to the building so there would be a lot of noises of people coming in and out.but overall a good stay</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Her place is excellent! Too bad we couldn't stay longer.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Det här är det bästa stället som jag bott på i New York. Nära till T-banan (200m) bra med utrymme, sköna sängar, 4 badrum med toalett och dusch, ett mycket väl utrustat kök (bra att ha med 4 hungriga tonåringar). Helt enkelt väldigt lätt att bo här. Området lungt och trivsamt vi tillbringade flera varma kvällar ute på bron.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It was a pleasure staying at Shae's place.  It's a quiet, clean apartment with a comfortable bed, nice kitchen, and a relaxing back outdoor space.  The shower is nice too.  Shae was very hospitable and checked up on me mid-visit to see if there was anything else I needed.  The neighborhood is chill and there's easy access to the J train--which will get you to Manhattan and the AirTrain to JFK airport.  You can't go wrong staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I loved this spot! It's bigger than most places you'll find in NYC in it's price range. The location isn't too bad. It's walking distance from 2 train lines. Communication may be a bit hard; with that said you have nothing to worry about. Shae provides you with everything you need and more. There is AC in the bedroom so you don't have to worry about the heat. I'd definitely stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall, I was happy with the experience. We entered the building using the code provides with no issues. Once you go through the doors, there are three doors there, one of them leads upstairs to where the apartment is. I was a bit concerned because I didnt have a key to the apartment door and would have to lave the door unlocked while away. I ended up finding the key on top of a closet in the shared common area within the building. A bit concerning, but I could lock the door nevertheless. There were towels, mouthwash and an assortment of soaps and shampoos at our disposal. Bed was big and comfortable, but the sheets felt cheap. There are two bathrooms with showers, which can come in handy if trying to save some time when getting ready to go out. The personal terrace is great and spacious, too bad it was too cold for us in January, but lovely space nonetheless. There is a TV in a rather small living room but no TV in the bedroom, which may be important to some. It has a full kitchen with plenty of plateware and utensils so you can cook up a meal if you wanna stay in. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Host never provided me with the door code, I also attempted to reach her by phone and text on 3 of the numbers she provides, no response AT ALL. So I had to make last minute reservations at a hotel, as I was upset with this whole process and didn’t even feel like searching for another property. This was not my first Airbnb rodeo, I just got ran into the wrong host. 1 day after my scheduled check in and she still didnt respond to my texts! This reservation was made 2 weeks prior to check in.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Pretty much as described and seen in photos. Didn't realize the second bed was a pull-out loveseat verses a regular sized one  but it wasn't too bad comfort-wise. Didn't seem like the best location for taking the train but we made due with Lyfts. Lots of space with a nice private patio on the back. Easy to get in and out and Shae was very responsive especially with some user errors made by us with the door lock.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een echte Airbnb, kamer in een appartement met gebruik van keuken en badkamer eigenaar. Aardige verhuurder, kleine maar comfortabel kamer, douche was niet echt schoon.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great value and a great host. Just know that it's quite a hike from the nearest subway station, so it will had some time to each journey. This is more annoying when the weather is bad.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Heather is really nice and open hearted! It was nice talking with her! She was very flexible with check in and check out time, which was very nice! We never saw her cat, so if you don’t like cats that shouldn’t be a problem.  The couch was very cozy! Connection to the subway was super close but the area she lives was a little scary sometimes but it was more than okay! If you really care about cleanliness then you’re at the wrong address. I didn’t really care though, it was just for the weekend and it was inexpensive and perfectly fine! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een huis in een leuke buurt met veel restaurants en koffieshops. Een uitstekend hamburger restaurant om de hoek. We werden hartelijk welkom geheten door David. Het is een authentiek huis, met een kleine badkamer en keuken. De bedden zijn prima. Je hebt meer dan genoeg privacy. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The accommodation a dream. The hosts anyway, they helped us where it was possible. From recommendations about hints to baked bread everything was fine. Even when we could not fly home as planned because of the bad weather, we were spontaneously taken up again and offered a roof over our heads. Samantha and Scott are the epitome of serious and good hosts. I would recommend anyone to stay here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The accommodation a dream.

On New Years Day, when almost everything is   closed, I was told to come back later because I checked in a few hours early after being given the wrong codes for the house. Honestly, the fact that I had to go all the way back to Manhattan to use the restroom and get something to eat really made me mad. Other than that, the only other complaint is that the ceilings are low, more specifically \"\"bumping your head against the ceiling if your taller than 6'2\"\"\"\" low. Wish I had known that before</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A bit of mixed reviews. The place  was pretty much as described. And I have to say it was very clean. But according to the thermostat, it was 86 degrees in the room because the ac unit was not working. Which to be fair, we came in too late(2ish)for the host to do anything about it. The bed was also very uncomfortable. Sheets kept coming off during the night. The tv was also kind of difficult to get working. And they didn’t actually have the small breakfast stuff they said I the description. Also when we were talking with the host, they came off a little cold in their responses. Especially when we told him about how hot it was in the morning. They didn’t seem to care. I don’t like to leave bad reviews, but this was not a pleasant experience. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Host largely non responsive via their various phone numbers until things went wrong and I had to contact AirBnB. Had to spend a night at a friends due to not being able to enter the property.(What would have happened if I did not have a friend in town...?) Did not anticipate my arrival, despite me sending two messages before I arrived (which were not responded to.) Worst AirBnB experience I've had by far, unfortunately.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay in Ava's place. Everything was clean, practical and perfect for two people. The apartment is just like as the pictures! It was not so close to Manhattan as we hoped, but the subway ride was not bad. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ava’s place was amazing. The moment we arrived, the place was clean and already was cozy enough for us to stay in. There were fresh sheets and towels and the place was clean. There were also complete amenities, especially in the kitchen. It was easy to cook also since there were complete amenities. The space was big enough for us and we were 4, it wasn’t too small nor too big; it really looks like the picture. The location of the house was not bad. It is really near the supermarket, which was great, and it was also close to a laundry place which helped a lot. Another is that it’s a 3-5 min walk to the closest subway which was very nice since we used the subway a lot to get to the city. Also the price of this place is pretty good, considering it’s in New York. Lastly, Ava was an amazing host since she was very hospitable and attentive to our needs. She just lives upstairs and is always ready to help. To end, I highly recommend that you stay in this place because it really will feel like home!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is very spacious, just as it’s shown in the photos. It’s very equipped with lots of things in the kitchen, and also plenty of towels and sheets. The only bad thing is that it is a bit dark, almost no natural light, and sometimes the pipes make noise during the night. But apart from that, the apartment is a great choice in Brooklyn as it is very close to the A and C train, and Ava has been a very nice host. She provided us with the extra keys we needed and she and Rabiat were always available for any questions that we had.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>If you want the quick review. The space was a great value. Clean spacious private apartment that was easily accessible by two train lines (the 1 and the C). If you want the detail the only issues we ran into. My friend went back late on a saturday night and couldn't get the keys to work. This was completely user error. I went back to help her out with it at 2 am and was able to get in right away. If you are someone who doesn't know how to work keys and a lock you might have issues with this apartment or I would say any apartment in that fact. (This has really turned into an inside joke with us now) I had an issue getting warm water for the shower on the morning I left but that was at 3:30 in the morning and I am sure I just worked it wrong. It was very clean the bed was super comfy and I enjoyed staying there. Hope they will have me in the future!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Soon was a great host! He gave us lots of suggestions of things to do and even picked up a subway map for us and showed us how to use it. He and his family were fun to talk to and very nice. His pets were really cute and nice too! The place was cute and really quiet, which is hard to find. It's pretty close to the subway too. The one thing is that I wouldn't walk alone from the subway after dark, especially as a girl. The neighborhood isn't super bad, but it just feels safer with someone. I'd totally recommend Soon's place to my friends!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het verblijf bij Soon & Francine was geweldig! Warme ontvangst met al onmiddellijk verschillende tips. Het huis is erg fijn ingericht, stijlvol en je merkt dat onmiddellijk dat dit echte breeddenkende, leuke en grappige mensen zijn waarmee je massa's interessante gesprekken kan voeren. De kamer en badkamer waren perfect in orde, goed bed, alles wordt voorzien. Soon & Francine zijn ook steeds bereikbaar voor vragen en helpen je met alles graag verder. Samengevat: wij verblijven ongetwijfeld opnieuw bij hen als we NYC nog eens bezoeken!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rebekah was very accommodating and answered promptly any inquiries I had. The location is fantastic and parking was not bad. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Awesome choice. I truly recommend this place to stay. I was in NY with my parents, so I was worried about get a great location, safe and clean place, and so on. In Rebekah's apt, I found all that. She was amazing. A couple steps to the metro station, really easy and fast to get in central Manhantan. There are great bar, restaurants and market around. If you´re planning go to NY, that´s a great choice, you won´t be wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rebekah's huis is een prima uitvalsplek om New York te verkennen. Het ligt 1 minuut lopen van de metro. (q lijn), een kwartiertje met de metro van Manhatten. Rebekah is een goede gastvrouw en verraste ons door ons een mifi toestel mee te geven, waardoor we in de hele stad wifi hadden. We moesten de badkamer delen, maar dat ging prima. Ook konden we op de dag van de terugreis onze bagage laten staan, omdat nieuwe gasten pas de volgende dag kwamen. Wel komt er veel verkeer door de straat, en is het niet stil, maar wij hadden er met slapen verder geen last van. Mocht ik nog een keer naar New York gaan, dan ga ik eerst kijken of ik bij Rebekah terecht kan!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>O apartamento do Ramon é um ótimo achado em Nova York. Muito bem localizado (Murray Hill), bairro residencial super tranquilo, com total segurança, e perto das principais atrações: Empire State Building, Broadway, Macy's (34th street), East River (cais com barcos para o Brooklin e passeios pelo rio) e etc. O comercio da área é muito diversificado e oferece uma infinidade de opções com bons restaurantes, bares e cafés. Tem 2 grandes supermercados perto, o Fairway e o Trader's Joe. Além do complexo gastronômico e delicatessem de comida italiana chamado EATALY, com restaurantes, pizzaria, café, padaria e um pequeno supermercado com frutas, legumes e verduras, Imperdível! Destaque também, para a feira de orgânicos que acontece todos os sábado na Union Square a poucas quadras de distância.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Could not say anything bad about this place or Tania, it was perfect and Tania was amazing!!!! Thank you!!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I'll make it simple: stay here! The apartment is great, the location is great, and the hosts are warm, welcoming, and responsive! You have a 24-hour organic grocery store one block away (read: you can get healthy food and Kombucha at 2 am if it fits your fancy).  You're a short walk to the Nostrand A express metro that will get you to Manhattan right quick. (But for people who don't know the NYC area, Brooklyn is so amazing, you may not want to leave - I spend whole weekends here never setting foot in Manhattan, just fyi.) The house itself has beautiful craftsmanship woodwork and friendly neighbors. The bed is very comfy, and the apartment is nice and quiet, and the kitchen well-equipped. (Ever stayed at an AirBnB where they clearly bought cruddy $2 nonstick plastic pans at the corner to cook with and leave not much  by way of dishes? Instead of that, they have nice cookware here, and a full cupboard of other utensils, etc., and NO non-stick pans, which are as bad for your health as they are the environment, I was so relieved!).\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Good location and facilities but the key pickup system can be a problem. The key pickup app sent us the wrong code and we couldn’t get the key out of the box. Also it’s a few blocks away and not ideal after hours or in cold conditions.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Danny was very quick to respond to our request and easy to communicate with. Considering we booked the place with only 24hrs notice everything went smoothly and the location is great. Only a 10 min walk to nearby subway which can get you anywhere. The place was large and they even stocked the fridge with bottled water which was much appreciated. AC was only in the separated bedroom which we didn't use but apparently they are adding an AC to the main living space which will be nice. We didn't need it because the weather was nice but over it was a great deal! Only downside is being in the 3rd floor without and elevator but it wasn't that bad and is pretty common for NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>I came in very late since my flight was delayed but the door was tricky to handle, and at first the dogs and neighborhood scared me, which made that situation even worse. But thankfully Elaine got up despite the time and helped us out. That was the most memorable part of the trip lol.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>they are very nice and the location is not so bad. So 5*</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ein relativ großer Raum mit 2 großen Doppelbetten und einem kleinen Bad mit Waschbecken und Toilette. Dusche wird im Hauptbad mitbenutzt. Gastgeber waren sehr nett, wir haben gute Gespräche gehabt und zusammen Basketball im TV geschaut. Man muss Haustiere mögen denn es waren 2 Hunde und 4 Katzen mit in der Wohnung. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It was difficult to check in as the wrong information was given for finding the key, and communication could have been better from the host, but overall it was a good value for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall, the stay at this place was very nice.  There is a bit of stairs (two major flights upwards), so if you have luggage it might be a bit of a struggle, but it wasn’t too bad.  The host said hello to us and left us alone, and we didn’t see them around much for most of our stays.  However, they were super responsive to questions we had via message, both prior to stay and during our stay.  We love the cats, they mostly chilled around the livingroom.  The two dogs tend to be very enthusiastic and jumpy but the hosts kept them mostly in their rooms.  The room was pretty spacious for two people, but there are no blinds/curtains on the window.  The kitchen looked clean although we didn’t use it.  The livingroom was also very cozy.  The commute into Manhattan took slightly longer than anticipated (about an hour to Time Square).  But the price is amazing for a good night of asleep and lots of lovely animals.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I booked Faith's place because my dad needed somewhere to stay while he was visiting. The hotels in the area were either ridiculously overpriced or had numerous bad reviews about their cleanliness (or lack thereof). This was my first time using airbnb, and having my dad stay here completely dismissed any reservations I had about using the service.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our flight was cancelled making our stay way shorter. Aside from having a bad experience at the airport Faith was very understanding of our stress. Her home is very cozy clean and has great amenities. She was so understanding and was flexible in extending our check out time since we lost a night due to our flight cancellation. If you are looking to book this home please do. You will not regret it. I loved that there was a local coffee shop close by. So if you love coffee then you definitely need to  book this home :D</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was my first time using airbnb and I stayed for a long work trip. Linda is deservedly a super host and I highly recommend after my long stay. The place is extremely comfortable and quiet and has absolutely everything you need. Linda was always able to fix things where needed etc and takes great care to provide all that you need. I found the studio to be perfectly equipped, it really made my life so much easier not to have to buy lots of stuff etc. I left early every morning and returned late at night weekdays and weekends and always felt very safe. There is the amazing Bagel Pub around the corner and a great coffee place opposite it. Also the laundrette is great nearby. You can run in Prospect Park about 4 or 5 blocks away which is super and there is a farmers market there at the weekend. The Brooklyn Museum and Botanic Gardens are minutes from Linda's place. There are several train options 2/3/4/5 and C with a walk and so its fantastic. Some other person reviewing here complained about the shower and I cleaned it everyday, it is old and needs to be done regularly to keep it in better condition. There were different people staying here at different times in the building but never caused me any noise issues etc. The heating comes on the morning at 5.30am very loudly which might concern some but earplugs should help. I stayed also during two bad snow storm and the  place was adequately heated and comfortable for a snow day. This place is deservedly that of a super host!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A good spot and close to great restaurants and shops. We stayed here in summer but we were very disappointed and more so due to the ineffective and noisy (if it worked the noise wouldn’t have been so bad) air conditioner. It is a small room and we kept all the doors closed yet we still woke up in the middle of the night sweating. More towels for people staying longer, be a bit more generous with the little things like soap (the small one bar supplied for long term stays), coffee was pretty much empty when we arrived etc. For the price, a hotel stay is of more value. We were disappointed and unfortunately these critical details put a cloud over the good things and then you start focusing on the small things. We’re seasoned travels and stay in all types of accommodation but we can’t recommend this one. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This place was absolutely adorable. The decor was beautiful and the place itself was very clean. There were a few cockroaches and a mouse, but that's usually what you sign up for in NYC. At one point I was given the wrong code for the lockbox to get the key to get in, but that was just a typo. Louisa and her family were very very sweet to us and werent a bother at all. The dog was a bit loud, but also super cute so the two cancelled out. The apartment was fairly inexpensive and a fantastic place for a couples getaway!! Located in a safe albeit loud neighborhood, this apartment was perfect for our trip. I would recommend this place to any 1-2 humans looking for a great time 30 min (depending on traffic) away from Times Square. Thanks Louisa!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Natasha was a great host! She was very flexible about our arrival time and worked with us when we arrived later than expected. The apartment location was amazing. It was only about three blocks from the subway and one from the bus. In addition, there were plenty of excellent restaurants within a block or two that were open late. The only downside about the location was the parking, although I assume it's just as bad everywhere in the city. Natasha was helpful in giving parking tips and it worked out perfectly. There were a few flights of steep and narrow stairs in order to reach the apartment, which could potentially cause problems for people with physical issues, but by no means did it affect me. The building was private and quiet and made for a great stay. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not a bad place to spend some time in NYC. This place was perfect for getting off the ground after moving to NYC. The cancellation policy was especially friendly, I was able to shorten my stay after finding an apartment (thank you so much). The neighborhood is pretty safe although a bit dark at night. It's very quiet. There is nothing glamorous about the place, but it's totally fine for sleeping, a shower, holding your things, cooking a meal, and going out to explore the city. I really enjoyed the decorations and books in the living room. Again, you can't expect much for the price (it's NYC, this is a steal!), but my expectations were exceeded. :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Staying with Chris was like staying with family.  He was very friendly and welcoming.  He was always willing to share his vast knowledge about New York and things to do there.  The bed was amazingly comfy and the kitchen was well equipped.  The neighborhood was nice and not a bad walk to the subway stations.  One is just a couple of blocks away.  We now feel like we have a friend in New York!  Highly recommended Airbnb.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lamee was not there when we arrived; his dad was around and navigated the lockbox. I later found the information in my email, sent after we were in transit. The apartment was spacious, economical, HOT and borders the projects (Stuyvesant Garden), with one way streets taking you through it! There were not enough towels for the 4 of us. After a day or so of sharing, I emailed Lamee. The next day there were towels and a requested fan, as the place was a sauna with very little air circulation, waiting outside the door. Looking for sheets for the couch bed, I pulled some out and dead/live bugs fell out. There was no microwave (for reheating/cooking) and the stove had burners that did not work. The oven worked okay but the temperature of the place, even with the fan, made its use seem like a suicidal cry for help. The refrigerator was not wiped after the last people and did not work at all (realized too late!) but the freezer sometimes worked as a refrigerator. This is important because it was advertised as being great for a traveling family….get some milk for the kids….not. We had to consume everything near immediately…makes the just right price not so just right as you are spending extra money at the corner store. We received a half roll or so of toilet paper, which did not last long between 4 females! We also had one trash 13-gallon bag for the entire stay, which was used up pretty quickly from all the extra food trash! Thank you corner store! There was no way to sort/recycle as is the law in NYC. The apartment is on the third floor so if you do not do narrow, long stairs with a dog and small child well, this is not the place. It was nice however that we could have the dog. The place is not well finished at all (“under construction”/rustic in places) but clean mostly (doors unpainted, cracked tiles, water damage, screen-less windows letting mosquitos in, screens with holes, slanting floor, no molding, painted metal tub pealing). Easy access to subway and bus is a 10-minute, BRISK, walk that starts to drag on when done with a small child. It is not reasonable at all to travel that way with a small child, who was then very tired before getting to the activity of the day….which took more walking….let me not even mention the return trip. I even tried to go to the different trains (A or J), nope still bad. Then there was the car service you can flag down on the corner of Monroe and Lewis…$7 to the J train. I saw Lamee on the last day, for a moment….literally…and he was down on the first floor the whole time! If traveling with kids this is a not. For the devil may care bunch this is perfect! We will not stay again, if we could have moved on from there sooner we would have.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>clean and modern appartment, with pretty comfortable beds. people down the street are sometimes a bit loud but that's not too bad and you do not hear traffic noises from the bedroom. kitchen is really useful.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Although I did not stay at Desmar's place due to a last minute scheduling conflict, I do feel like I should write a review.  I highly recommend if ever staying in the Bronx to stay at Desmar's place.  He was easy to reach and provided responsive coordination when needed.  He even went out of his way to help try and alleviate some of the conflict.  If you are looking for a place to stay while in the Bronx, I say you can't go wrong with Desmar.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was very clean and neat. We had towels, bad sheets, dishes and everything we needed. Desmar and his girllfriend were amazing hosts. Since we were first time in NYC, they were really helpful about everything. The location is really good. Subway is on 5 minutes walk. There is store nearby that is open 24/7. Also, a lot of cheap places to eat. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Goeie locatie, grote leefruimte, ideaal vr 5 p met de 2 badkamers, ontbijten in de loft was leuk, geen nachtlawaai, enkele goeie restaurants in de buurt, een aanrader !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"There's nothing really to \"\"expect\"\" here at this Air BnB rental. No bad expectations at least. Everything was perfect</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was nice travel and experience but due to the driver, my impression was so so so bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Louis was a perfect host, very helpful, kind and patience. He provided us everything we needed. The apartment itself was very cozy, extremely cleaned, spaceous, confortable with 2 large badrooms, one being a suite. 2 large bads and comfortable. It counts with a complete kitchen. The apartment was completed private. The area around was safe and close to many restaurants, grocery atores, fastfood and just 3 blocks away from the train station line Q which will take you to Manhattan (downtown, middletown or uptown) or coney island in the opposite direction quickly. I also recommend you to visit Prospect Park which i enjoyed a lot. Its perfect and beutiful as Central Park. Also it is 30m from the train station in Parkside Av. I really recommend you to stay in Louis' Place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Eenvoudig maar goed appartement. 2 badkamers, schoon en goede bedden. Louis is vriendelijk, maar hebben we na het moment van aankomst niet meer gezien.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay with Rez was pleasant. Her apartment is located conveniently close to the subway and some nice bars and cafe's. We did find Rez to act a little cold towards us at times however we did get off to a bad start arriving later than expected from the airport on the first night. Overall it worked reasonably well for us and it was good value for money. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>My boyfriend and I stayed in Dan's place for a week  long vacation. Upon arrival, we entered the wrong address in Uber from JFK airport to Dan's place. I gave them a call which was immediately answered. Dan and his wife helped us choose the right address to put into Uber. Their willingness and patience  to help was very appreciated.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is gorgeous, spacious, sunny and clean. Very much like you see in the pictures. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The neighborhood has a very relaxed, lovely atmosphere with a market nearby. It is not super close to the nearest subway station but the walking distance is not so bad. And there is a bus for that, although it does not come as often and on time. But that could be a good chance to meet Greenpointers. The internet could be faster but works. Anyways, I had a great time at this place and I would definitely stay there again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This listing was no frills, as advertised. Hugo is a very nice person. The wifi was great, and the location was very good as well. There is also towels and soap provided. That all being said, turtles roaming around the bathroom? That gave off bad vibes, was very unexpected is unsanitary. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>When I first arrived to Hugo's I was a bit worried.   After settling in I have to say the room is quite charming .  Actually the whole area is .  Little cafe tables on the outside walk of the Airbnb( to bad it rained the whole time).  I fell in love with the place .  The whole apartment is going through a full renovation and many upgrades .   The place is super clean .   There is a collection can for extra change to feed homeless cats!     My Uber ride to LGA was only 19.00.   \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was great! Very clean just like the photos! The place was in a great location in park slope Brooklyn. It was close to many restaurants and cafes. If you are driving, parking wasn't too bad at all! Michael was great and super friendly! Even left me and my husband chocolate treats the day we arrived. He was very understanding, even though we had arrived super late to the place. Thanks again! Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again on another visit to Brooklyn ny! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Staying here was my very first Airbnb experience...and I'm happy to report that it was a wonderful one!  Michael was a gracious host and although I only met him in person upon checking in, he always responded to my questions in a timely manner--whether I reached out by text or the Airbnb app.  The place was spacious and spotless. I liked the option to brew a cup of strong (Gorilla) coffee each morning and having a bowel of the cereal I had brought--a helpful way for me to save money vs eating out every meal.  On my final morning, I did treat myself to brunch at Pure Bistro --served all day every day--and both the food and the staff were great! Don't forget to try one of their healthy smoothies/juiced drinks--amazing!  All in all, you cannot go wrong here~ a safe, family friendly way to experience the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn with easy access to the big city.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great place and terrific hosts! Met all our needs and beyond. Owner even picked us up when we got confused on the subway and ended up in the wrong area! We were also greeted with breakfast bagels one morning. Super clean, plenty of space, and close to dining, coffee shops, grocery stores, Barclays Center, and the subway. Would stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hannah’s place was fantastic! It was exceptionally appointed and wonderfully styled. It felt like home. The king size bed was pure heaven and was hard to extract oneself from because it was so comfortable. The outdoor area was a rare treat and would be amazing in spring and summer (too bad it was so cold). \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Helemaal prima voor 4 personen met eigen keuken en badkamer, metrostation(s) om de hoek, \"\"the best pancakes and bagels in town\"\" en supermarkten ook - wat wil je meer in New York! Het was heerlijk!\"</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Carlyn and her place were simply amazing.  She was a very warm and accommodating host.  She made us feel right at home.  Super Clean and modern.  Can't go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This apartment was so stylish and cute! It was clean and easy to check in to. David wrote many thoughtful tips for us to explore. We had dinner the first night at the sushi place he recommended down the street and it was great. If you read the comments yes the loft ceiling for the bedroom is low but I’m 5’2 so I had no problem with it. We spent most of our time in the living room / terrace anyway. This place is location location location! You can’t go wrong and it was priced very reasonably. I would definitely recommend to friends.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>tolle kleine aber zweistöckige wohnung mitten im williamsburg. super anbindung. genau mittig zum L-train (etwas näher) und marcy avenue. wir waren zu sechst, das ist mM etwas zuviel, auch wenn es drei kleine getrennte schlafzimmer gibt. aber die bad situation bedarf timing und absprachen ;) und man kann zu sechst nicht richtig zusammen essen. um die küchenzeile können manche sitzen und zwei müssen stehen... alles in allem war es aber ein toller aufenthalt. die zimmer haben fenster und balkon wie dachzugang ist für nyc schon selten genug</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Der Kontakt zu Paulina war stets super und sie hat schnell auf Fragen geantwortet sowie Tipps und Hinweise gegeben. Die Unterkunft ist für 4 Personen super, bei 6 Personen könnte es eng werden. In der Wohnung waren alle notwendigen Dinge vorhanden, wie Toilettenpapier, Duschbad etc., so dass man diese nicht extra kaufen braucht. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hannah was so welcoming and lovely! The decor in the apartment is amazing! It is very comfortable, good wifi. Not a bad word to say about the place. Location is great! Loved our stay and would definitely go back next time!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ultimately, when you use an Airbnb you are staying in someone’s home and are subject to their rules and ways of being. I was supposed to stay here for two and a half months due to work but only stayed for a month and I am glad I changed my stay. First, the location is great and right on a tube stop. The room is large/comfortable and Ivan ultimately is a good host and great communicator. For these things if you are staying for a short period of time I say go for it! If you are staying for a long period of time and plan on doing things in the place besides sleeping etc. I might consider another option. In my month stay I found a few things that need to be addressed. First they ask for you to take your shoes off at the door but they do not have a vacuum. They do sweep often but it doesn’t pick up all the dust that accumulates on a hardwood floor. I can forgive this. When I arrived there where no sheets on the bed and only a duvet cover so I bought my own. Host stated he had sheets but didn’t put them on the bed because it was hot. I don’t understand this logic but could be cultural. There is a smoker that lives in the apt and this has to be placed in the listing. I asked him to stop smoking in the residence and he only did so when I asked for my money back for the rest of the stay after I became ill for a second time. He was extremely apologetic. I strongly suggest they take kitchen usage off the listing as the woman that lives there doesn’t really want people using it. I do understand that people have different standards of clean and I have no idea what happened with other guests but when you have 5 people cooking it’s hard to know who does what. Ivan had to argue with her to let me use the stove when I arrived and she is constantly checking behind people to see if they have followed her rules. There are notes that she leaves around the apt. for guests to follow instead of actually speaking to people. She doesn’t seem to be a people person and comes across as very judgmental. Ivan left the last week and so I had to checkout with her and she wanted to “inspect” the room. This is understood butI told her I had to go to work and she must arrive with a certain period of time yet she was around 25 minutes late so I just left. These things and the smoking where the major downsides to my month stay. Again it’s not bad if you are coming to just sleep as once you close your door they do respect your privacy. And you don’t mind the smoking Ivan does have wonderful conversations.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dit is een heel leuk en comfortabel appartement, van alle gemakken voorzien en in een prettige buurt, met supermarkt en restaurantjes en zo om de hoek, en een hele snelle metroverbinding met Manhattan. Aangename woon- en slaapvertrekken, prima badkamer, 2e wc, fijne keuken, en -- nooit eerder meegemaakt maar net als in de film -- een lift die uitkomt in je woonkamer. Verder op de 11e etage een kleine fitnessruimte en aan beide zijden van het gebouw een dakterras, met aan een kant (die van de fitnessruimte) fraai uitzicht richting East River en Midtown Manhattan. We moesten wel even wennen aan het matras (Tempur), dat kostte één nacht, maar daarna was het net zo lekker als thuis. Nicky stuurde ons tijdig een informatiepakket, dat was ook handig. Vriendelijke portiers waar we de sleutels konden halen en terugbrengen. En alles brandschoon. Al met al een aanrader.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Amazing experience!  This was my first time using airbnb and it was great. Traveled alone to NYC and Mario and his brother were excellent hosts.  They helped me in everything I needed and showed me how to move around. In general the place was very good and my room was perfect! Just 3 blocks away from 125 st station. At the beginning I wasn't so sure about the neighborhood but at the end it wasn't that bad. Mario, Thank you! Had an amazing time!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very spacious apartment. I globally appreciate my stay because I was really independent in the meaning that they are not at all on your back, they really let you live your life. Only bad point was the shower that didn't work properly for my all stay (15 days), was just a nightmare to wash my hair. However the hosts are really friendly and nice. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I wanted to leave on day 1 because it was too noisy according to my standards (overlooking Broadway boulevard  with heavy traffic : buses, trucks, ambulance horns) and bad bed (springs in the back) but was forced to stay 2 weeks because I had initially booked the full month. One bathroom shared for 4 rooms. But the place is clean (you are asked to take off your shoes) and things improved when I was asked to move to a room at the rear.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The best place I've stayed in NYC for sure. Ayodele is a super nice guy that will help you in everything you need. I wish I've stayed longer. Next time im going NY I will rent the bedroom for sure. Subway is 2 min walking, in 25 min you are in wall street. Everything was awesome. Not a bad thing to say. Thank you for everything Ayodele. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed with Ayodele's apartment for 11 nights. Simone, his girlfriend, greeted us at the house - she was very welcoming and gave us helpful info about the closest station/supermarkets etc. She also warned us that it can feel unsafe for women especially to walk alone around the area at night, but I was with my boyfriend so it wouldn't be so bad. Ayodele was away on business for the first four days. He was nice, friendly and mostly stayed in his work room in the house. We felt comfortable in the house. Overall we really liked the apartment - it was clean, well kept, with good facilities like washing, drying, good kitchen and air conditioning, and is just as it was shown in the pictures. Also the room is sound proofed quite well - so even when the tv was on, we were never disturbed. A few negatives are: it's about 50 mins - 1h to get to central places like times square and central park, which got quite tiring to do everyday. The neighbourhood, Crown heights, is a little run down - and at night times it felt unsafe to us to walk to the apartment from the station. On a couple of occasions at night, a few strangers talked at us, (whom we ignored) and it felt quite intimidating. Also the neighbourhood can be loud - there were many people playing music out loud on the streets at night - but if you sleep with ear plugs, thus shouldn't be a problem. Overall we had a good stay here, but if I were to go to New York again, I'd choose to stay somewhere closer to central Manhattan and in a better area.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hele leuke studio in een rustige buurt. Vlakbij de subway, op een kwartiertje sta je in Grand Central, op een klein half uurtje in SOHO. Verschillende winkels en kleine restaurants in de buurt (Lexington Avenue). Gelegen vlak bij Central Park. De studio biedt alle comfort. Een goed uitgeruste keuken, een verzorgde badkamer en feilloze Wifi en TV. Zeer vlotte en snelle communicatie met de eigenaars. Zij wonen in hetzelfde gebouw en staan steeds ter beschikking. Alles voor een onbezorgd verblijf in NY.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>De studio van Amy is op de derde verdieping van een zeer sympathieke oudere woning met voor- en achtertuintje waar ook haar broer Steven en nicht Kirsten wonen. Je voelt je dus opgenomen in een familie. Het appartement is stijlvol ingericht met alle noodzakelijke voorzieningen (keuken, badkamer, wifi) en een gezellige zithoek, mooie en leuke decoratieve details. De buurt is Spanish Harlem, vroeger blijkbaar een no-go zone, nu een levendige, veilige  en aangename buurt met kleine winkels (o.a. een Franse bakker!) en eethuizen, vele oudere woningen worden gerenoveerd. De grote uptown-downtown metrolijn (4-5-6) is om de hoek zodat je op een halfuurtje in het hart van Manhattan bent. En ook Central Park is vlakbij. Ideaal om wat afstand van het drukke downtown-NY te krijgen. ' Avonds en 's nachts is het erg rustig. Wij bevelen dit verblijf zeer graag aan!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Amy was very rude host. She didnt show up from the begining. Aircondition was working badly so i ask her to fix this..she didnt make it. Then i beg her to call a taxi for me because my mother was sick and we didnt want to search on the streets for the cab. She didnt did it and she was very rude. I would never go to her again. She told me that i am the worst host which she ever had and complained on me that i had to much demands. All i wanted was good aircondition and safe ride back to the airport and instead of this i was called stupid baby and she told me that i have to be in four season if i want someone to call me a taxi. I would never come again. She made my last evening in NYC very bad... \n</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>We had a good stay in this apartment and the location is great. You get what you pay for and I've seen both worse and better places in NY. We were very welcomed by the host and he gave us all the information we needed. The only negative thing I have to say is that there was a construction going on right outside the windows of the apartment, which meant loud noises early in the morning.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>For nyc, this was a steal of a deal.  It's about 3 blocks to the subway which isn't bad, but with the kids and luggage I would opt for a lyft or uber instead of a subway.   Laura and Matt are so friend and accommodating.  They're quick to respond back when you have questions and helpful with suggestions and tips about the city.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is great, very well located and have everything you can possible need. The only thing is that it's a little bit noisy because it's close to the street and there's a missing glass right next to the aircon, but it's not too bad. The location compensates, it's close to very nice restaurants and subway stations. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Awesome location! You can roam the neighborhood right outside your door or walk less than a block to the subway that can take you anywhere in the city! Great entertainment right around the corner with two comedy clubs. I thought it would be noisy based on previous reviews which I was fine with and brought ear plugs just in case, but it wasn't bad at all! I was even there on a Friday and sat night and wasn't bothered a bit. Bed is super comfortable, so that helped! I would def stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The apartment is lovely, in a great location in Midtown and good value for having your own place in Manhattan. The room is nicely decorated and a good size, and the bed is very comfy. The bathroom was also good with great water pressure and temperature on the shower. Some of the reviews have commented on the noise from outside - I can't say it's any worse than I expected in central Manhattan. Samira offered me earplugs when I arrived, I used them at night and slept like a baby. The subway and bus station are just around the corner but there are plenty of sights you can walk to easily from the place. Samira was easy to meet and communicate with (it's helpful her living in the building), friendly and responsive with any questions I had - she also put herself out to let me store luggage in the building before check-in time.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room was ok but did not expect it to be part of a floor full of rooms for rent (this may easily have been my bad for not reading the instructions more closely) and the noise was the street was palpable all night.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is really close to the subway, just down the block. Super clean apt and very cozy. Kind of stuffy since it’s in the basement but thanks god for the fan! Can hear footsteps of ppl walking upstairs very loudly but overall this place wasnt bad. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was my first time in New York, Jenya patiently wait for me to arrive even I was a bit lost to find my way. The location was good, not too far from most tourist hot spot. I feel safe around the neighborhood. The apartment was very  basic, if you are just staying for a few nights and you don't need much, it's good for you. However compare to similar location you can find something with similar price but a bigger apartment. Overall it's not a bad experience, however I do feel It's a little overprice.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Jenny and the apartment were amazing. We had a friend arriving at a different time than my wife and I and she accommodated wonderfully.  Communication was perfect and the apartment was exactly what we needed. 2nd floor so you don't have to walk up many stairs. If you are looking for a real New York experience, you've found it. Right in the middle of LES and about a 2 minute walk to the subway which in two stops will connect you to anywhere. Plenty of restaurants and true New York feel in the East Village just steps away from the door. Uber and Taxis are available within seconds. Perfect spot away from tourist Manhattan. Go for a walk and stumble into bottomless mimosas or an authentic French restaurant where everyone actually was from France.  You cannot go wrong with the accommodations, location, or host. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>if the bad be quiet will be better</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Pablo's place is in a great location-- right in the action on the UWS and next to Central Park.  The apartment is relatively clean, though oddly outfitted and laid out. Most of the drawers and closets are locked and there is no TV.  Nothing is in bad condition, but for the per-night price you would expect a little nicer, newer furnishings and quality of apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tom was welcoming when we arrived, and along with his dog, Buddy, was friendly. He and his girlfriend are social and local so are good resources for restaurants, bars, parks, etc...  All in all, this would be a great place for a student or young person looking to party or hang out and craving a back yard and not too fussy about amenities or cleanliness. Fairway, an exceptional grocery store is very close and a MAJOR perk. The waterfront park is charming with movie nights in summer. Red Hook is a fun neighborhood, but keep in mind, it's sleepy during the week and it is long ways to get to the rest of Brooklyn and Manhattan unless you have a car—you're looking at 45 mins to an hour on the subway/bus unless you take the ferry, which is not really practical on a daily basis nor economical. Lots of street parking.The apartment itself is adequate but not entirely comfortable and I wouldn't recommend for a long stay. Though listed as a 1 bedroom, it's more like a large studio since there are no doors for privacy. Contrary to the listing, the bath is somewhat older, though it's listed as renovated and very small. While a washer/dryer was listed as included in the apartment it's actually outside and coin operated. The bed is uneven (collapsed in the center). And generally no place aside from the bed to be very comfortable (could use a sofa). The apartment is dark except in the kitchen. The kitchen itself, while visually attractive, could use more pots and pans, glasses and, dishes, though all in all was quite nice and spacious. The small private garden is nice, and came with a small charcoal BBQ, but the drain was clogged and would flood when it rained and made the mosquito really bad.  Also meant that there were a few days we couldn't use it. We mentioned this to Tom, but not sure anything could be done at the time. The linen was stained/old and just didn't feel quite clean. Floors were dirty. While we were there we heard regular loud base music from the neighbor through the walls and they had a really loud party one night until 2:30 in the morning. I would say that's the kind of thing to mention to potential guests before they book and I've noticed other guests have mentioned as well. So it's worth asking before booking if they plan on hosting any parties. Tom was gracious about refunding us the 1 night when the party was going on. As much as we like Tom, we won't be returning due to the above.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hemos estado 3 parejas en el apartamento durante 11 días y la verdad es que nos ha parecido muy buena opción. Bien situado con el centro, una zona en la que no hemos tenido ningún problema con nadie, la gente del barrio muy amable. El apartamento limpio y amplio, con todo lo necesario para estar tantos días. Quizás hemos echado algo en falta una lavadora, pero era un mal menor. Tiene hasta una terraza que no es habitual encontrarse algo así en Nueva York, aunque le hubiera hecho falta un mantenimiento, lo hemos usado mucho. Tae siempre se ha preocupado porque todo estuviese bien, no coincidimos pero hablamos por mensaje si teníamos cualquier duda y la verdad es que hemos acabado muy contentos.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Good deal, neighborhood was chill, place was nice and spacious for one or two people on a budget. Could use a bit of a scrub, if you're particular about clean this may not be for you, but nothing too bad. Nick was very helpful and assiduous with issues that arose, internet went down from construction and he found a solution, got us the keys on time, always quick to respond. Great library, wish I had time to crack into it, would recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Min ven og jeg var rigtig glade for at bo i Nicks lejlighed! Vi mødte ikke selv Nick, men kontakten med ham var nem. Vi blev budt velkommen af Nicks kæreste, Jamala, der viste os rundt i lejligheden og anbefalede et par steder i nabolaget. Kvarteret er pænt, hyggeligt og livligt. Lejligheden i sig selv var stor, bogudvalget glimrende og prisen helt retfærdig. Vores største problem var, at det kolde vand på badeværelset ikke fungerede, så det var ikke altid en fornøjelse at gå i bad. Køkkenet har det mest basale udstyr, så det er fint at lave mad der. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not good, not bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place! Tom and his team are really on it! Very clean. Nice amenities. Solid location. Nothing bad to say about it! We were very happy with our stay and would have no reservations staying again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This near Columbia Univ spot is close but if traveling back and forth to Columbia, be prepared to climb 4 flights of steps in the dark at night thru Morningside park.  That's fine as long as you don't have luggage. The place was a bit difficult to access as you need to memorize 2 door codes and carry a key.  The shower, all though looks cool, is unnecessarily difficult to operate.  And may be difficult to exit if you were elderly.  I also arrived for check-in as the cleaning service was leaving. I know they cleaned but I am not certain they changed the sheets.  There was lint on the sheets, and on day 2, I found a dirty sock from another guest lodged between sheets and the arm rest of the pullout couch.  If the sheets were changed, I think the cleaning service would have found it. Toilet paper could use an upgrade it was the cheap 1 ply.  I also think that the bed was uncomfortable.  It is a pullout couch and a foam mattress but it was thin or just old.  I had to double up the comforter and sleep with that on top of the mattress.  Lastly it is a garden appartment, at the end of the hallway is another door to a room.  I could hear residents in that adjoining room clearly. Lack of silence and privacy was disappointing.  However,  not all was bad, snacks  available to guest (although I did not partake). Bathroom and hallway looks newly remodeled.  Decor is nice, and most importantly the host is friendly and responsive.  They use an automated system so as to ensure you are contacted.  All in all, the place is fairly priced, but not a bargain.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Cool and cozy loft space, tastefully and thoughtfully decorated, with a rooftop right outside the window. We had a great time chilling in the apartment and the neighborhood full of great restaurants and coffee shops. We didn't meet Enrico in person, but Enrico was friendly and helpful throughout and gave very clear instructions for check-in and check-out. The only drawback is that the apartment is not soundproof, with voices and music clearly audible from neighboring flat late at night and early in the morning-- not bad music though ;)  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location in terms of access to subway, only about a five minute walk. Would be great for warmer months, but was not suited for two Aussies during a cold snap! We were just too cold in -8 C temps. Occasional smell of cigarette smoke from below during the day. Best mattress I've ever slept on! Enrico is great at responding promptly. We caught the subway everywhere - really easy - not a lot close in general area. In warmer months not a bad walk to some cool restaurants though.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is a place for a quick stay, it is relaxed, it is not a bad location. The room is a bit small and you share the bath. I had a nice welcome and good stay. It is a simple place to sleep, nothing else, I got what I expected.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This location is very much a hostel! However, for the price, you cannot go wrong! Very small rooms but you'll just use them for sleeping - host was very accommodating and the entire hostel was spotless. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Maria was extremely prompt in replying and welcoming, even though we didn't meet her personally! We had a good and value stay in their cozy apartment over New Years' Eve, where everywhere else was extremely expensive. It is about 15-20 mins walk to Brooklyn Bridge, and 7-10mins walk to a metro station. It is nested in a residential area, with a 24h supermarket about 3 mins walk away :) However, do not expect a modern and extremely clean apartment. The ventilation was rather bad when we were cooking, and the toilets were decent but not the cleanest. Also, do take note that it is five flights up the stairs with no elevators!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Megan and Andy has a very cozy apartment and me and my wife were very happy with the room and all matters with renting it through airbnb. We were out for most of the days and usually didn't come back until late in the evenings so we didn't meet Megan and Andy very much, which made us feel two things; 1) like we had the whole apartment for ourselves 2) too bad, since they seemed super nice. Their apartment is located close to the L-train which took us to town fast and well and the surrounding area is nice with bars, cafes and small late night grocery stores. We would very much recommend to rent this room from Megan and Andy.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Megan and Andy's place was just as described. Super clean, located in a trendy area, and they were flexible with my schedule. Only thing is it's up 4-5 flights of stairs without an elevator, which I'm sure is rather normal for the east coast, but I'm from California so I thought that was the only bummer. I came down with a bad cough/cold so I had to cancel a couple of our originally booked days (didn't want to contaminate the whole apartment).  They understood and worked it out so I can pick up the keys elsewhere when I was available to show up (due to the strict cancellation and late notice, I couldn't receive a partial refund). I didn't get to talk to either of them much because of our schedules, but Megan left a detailed guide and tips handout on the bed for instructions. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Awesome place. The room is exactly as in the picture, and it has new mobile, good light and the entire apartment is super clean. We found everything we needed and the decoration is also great. We didn't have the opportunity to talk much with them, but Megan and Andy were nice and professional. They also gave us good tips of what to do around in Brooklyn. The only \"\"bad\"\" part was the stairs</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>There was just about everything a standard hotel would have from towels to a blow dryer, to soap. But with the warmth of a home, and little extras that we would not have thought we needed till we got there. It was in walking distance to just about everything else we needed from food to convenience and subway stations for the leisure touristy stuff we went for. This was my second trip to NY and staying off the island was a little more work buy totally worth it, I was able to explore Brooklyn/Williamsburg and I wouldn't have been able to do that if we didn't pick this cute place to stay at. Definitely worth it, for the price we paid you couldn't ask for a better deal. The only drawback is the 5 story walk up but honestly it wasn't that bad lol... The building itself was fairly quiet. We didn't hear a single neighbor until we were leaving. Bummed we didn't get to meet our host but maybe another time. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice stylish home, perfect if you’re travelling solo or with one other. Within a 10 minute walk to multiple subway stations, and around 20 odd minutes into the city, a very convenient location. Met Megan briefly, she was very accommodating and friendly! Only downside is the stairs, wouldn’t recommend for someone with bad knees, otherwise a great leg workout!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I’ll start with a few positive notes. It is a cute house, and the room I stayed in was simple and comfortable. I had just sprained my ankle, so it was hard for me to go up and down the stairs, and guests have to use the basement bathroom, so that was a challenge for me. The location isn’t the greatest, not safe to walk around at night. You’re close to a bus stop, and the train stop is about a 10-15 min walk, but I don’t think you should use it at night. Other then that I slept well, but the host works from home and on the phone quite a bit. Walls are thin. She wasn’t a great communicator, very short via messaging. She wasn’t clear regarding her availability on the date I would check in. I also never confirmed a check in time, just asked about the earliest, which was at 11 am. We touched base at noon, she asked about my eta, because she had “to go out for a bit” assuming that means 30-40 min, so I told her I was ok to come in closer to 2.  I reached out to her on my way to her place, and she said she would return around 3:30 which left me no choice but to wonder around her not so safe area w luggage and a bad ankle. Then I sat on her stoop around 3, thinking 3:30 she would show up, she came back at 4:30 had no sense of urgency, nor apologized. She was rude via text when I asked if she could come closer to 3 or 3:30, she took a while to respond, she was just having lunch in the city when she could have stayed close to the neighborhood out of courtesy. When she finally showed up she didn’t say hello or any sort of greeting. So that was weird, I had to ask her if she was Shelley. Her partner that was with her was somewhat friendly, gave me brief instructions and that was it. They leave you alone which is great, but I totally felt uncomfortable. I didn’t feel a warm hospitality vibe, and really didn’t want interact with her.  So I just stayed in my room when I was there and stayed out most of the day. I didn’t let it affect my time in the city though, and luckily there was another guest there that was super sweet. This is my experience and perception but maybe you’ll have a better one. Good luck.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Marissa, Stanley and Luna were great, very friendly and helpful hosts. This was my first booking with airbnb and they made sure it is certainly not my last. The room was as described, very clean, quite big, and comfortable. WiFi was very fast and I could use the laundry of the house. The place is approx. 35 min away from Penn Station with the A-train (which is very easy...). You can not be wrong staying here!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Morgan & Leslie-Anne's place truly gives you a taste of living in New York. The neighborhood is a great mix of grocery stores, restaurants and local shops. Any type of food you're feeling is within blocks. If you have trouble with stairs, this may not be the place for you. There are five flights of stairs to get to the apt, a true hike carrying heavy and bulky luggage, after that, it's not that bad. The apartment is very nicely decorated. This IS their home so of course the kitchen is fully stocked, there are toiletries in the bathroom and there are items in the closets. Overall we had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sean’s place is fabulous! His place feels very cozy and comfortable, with an awesome roof deck to chill out on.  Perfect spot in the heart of the West Village. The 5 floors up aren’t bad and added to our steps goals lol!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi trivdes otroligt bra hemma hos Zaineb! Rummet var precis som på bilderna, stort och rymligt, med egen ingång och litet badrum. Helt ok kommunikationer in till Manhattan och området var bra. Zaineb var även en fantastiskt trevlig och hjälpsam värdinna. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We hebben een geweldige tijd gehad bij Zaineb. Vanaf het begin reageerde ze snel en duidelijk. Daarnaast was ze ook nog eens ontzettend aardig en hulpvaardig. Helaas hebben we haar niet heel vaak gezien, aangezien we zelf heel veel op pad waren. Het appartement was groot, schoon en leuk ingericht. Bonuspunten voor de eigen ingang, de eigen badkamer en het dakterras :-)\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This place has everything you need! It’s a great location and easy to get a lot of subway stations. You really can’t go wrong with this place! Zaineb was super helpful too - we really enjoyed our time here.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Our stay in Tribeca was very welcoming. Josie had the refrigerator stocked with goodies, which was awesome. The Nespresso machine was great for morning coffee,  and so was the loft itself. The decor was wonderful and loft was very clean. You can't go wrong with a loft experience in NY with exposed brick walls and high ceilings. It really had a great vibe to it. So, if you are looking for an NY place with character, this is it!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is a pretty convenient place,  near subway express line. You get to down town around 15 mins. Andrew is a very nice host, sometimes you can hear his music playing at the house. The only bad side is that we have killed three mosquitoes during our stay, kinda surprised.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Honestly I cannot say enough good things about my time at Anthony's place. I was there for almost 2 weeks and I felt like I was right at home! Anthony and his wife are gracious and impeccable hosts. The room is clean, the bed is amazingly comfortable and there's even a big TV and wifi in the room! Anthony gives you full access to his kitchen and my own private bathroom was clean and toiletries were even provided! I highly recommend Anthony's place because of its close to the 3 line (across the street) and it's quiet, residential neighborhood. Anthony and his wife also have a toddler who is adorable and super fun! You can't go wrong staying at this place! Thank you again guys!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a basic place, no frills, not large, bathroom is tight. This was the first time I have had to share a bathroom, I personally will not do that again! When you have to pee, you have to pee! So all in its not bad and is reflected by th</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Anthony's lejlighed er som der vises på billederne. Sengen var komfortabel, og der var god plads til to mennesker. Værelset og badeværelset var ret småt, men det var for os ikke det store problem. Køkkenet var derimod ikke særlig hygiejnisk, og det forhindrede os lidt i at lave måltider.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"This is the first time I'm writing a \"\"bad\"\" review...: The room is tiny</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Christina was super helpful and kind. The apartment has a great location with lots of nice pubs and coffee shops around. The only bad side of the room is that it was getting too warm when heat was turned on, so I had to use fans a lot. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I thought this place was great. Right on the edge of the Williamsburg bridge, Aurea's place is just big enough for three close friends or a couple. Everything was very clean and as described. A perk is that Aurea had updated the apartment and it's very cute. Just note that this is a sixth floor WALK UP. No elevator (not necessarily a bad thing just something to keep in mind). We had a great stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi følte os meget velkommen. Der var lagt badehåndklæder frem, sengen var redt og der var stillet lidt vand og lidt slik frem til os, da vi ankom.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time! We love your house! Too bad we can't stay for longer. We can visit you the next time we visit New York! Happy late thanksgiving and wish you an early merry Christmas:)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Brendan and Karlie are super nice. They helped a lot during my trip! When I arrived their apartment, I thought that I found the right place, but I was wrong. At that time, Brendan helped a lot.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dichtbij het openbaar vervoer, rustige en veilige buurt. Voelde ons niet heel erg welkom. Jillian is heel aardig en gastvrij maar haar man gaf ons niet echt het gevoel dat we welkom waren. Niet onaardig maar was naar onze mening niet blij dat deel van zijn ruime gedeeld moest worden. Nadeel is dat er maar 1 badkamer is zonder apart toilet. Als iemand staat te douchen kun je al de tijd niet naar het toilet en Jillian doucht graag heel lang..</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed staying at Jillian's. She set everything up for us just perfectly and the room was squeaky clean. She provided us with every info we needed and it was definitely a positive experience. You cant go wrong with this place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>John is een sympathieke gastheer. Het appartement is comfortabel en gezellig ingericht. De keuken is voldoende uitgerust. De ligging vonden we geweldig. Je kan snel naar Manhattan met de metrohalte vlakbij of met de ferry, en Williamsburg is een levendige, aangename buurt tjokvol leuke koffiebars, winkels en restaurants. We verbleven in het appartement met 2 kleine kinderen en vonden de 2 slaapkamers dan ook heel praktisch. Handig is ook het reisbedje voor baby's. Er is ruimte genoeg en op het eind van de straat is ook een park (met gratis openluchtzwembad). Zeker een aanrader!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was nice and homey. The place is not too far from the subway, so going in to Manhattan was not too bad. Mornings can be a bit noisy because there are children running upstairs. But not really an issue.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was a very nice stay in this  beautiful apartment ideal for our family with 3 persons. The interior is modern and everything is working and very clean. The host family was very friendly and the response for questions was very fast. The only bad thing was the high price for groceries in the small shops in the neighbour hood. But I guess that would be the same situation in every place in New York.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>staying at michael's apartment was a fabulous expereince. i took the wrong subway and michael was so helpful and patient in getting me in the right direction. i really appreciated his help and he made me feel at home when i arrived; even though it was quite late after our arranged meeting time. he stocked the apartment with water and yummy snacks...bonus!! michael gave a lot of tips on things to see and i felt comfortable right away. the apartment is really cozy and very clean. it rained during our stay and we were happy to see that michael provided sturdy umbrellas. the apartment had everything we needed and michael is a caring and gregarious host. would definitely recommend and we will be back again. thanks michael!!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The only thing wrong with our stay at Michael's apartment in Harlem was that we could only spend three nights there. Communication with Michael was really easy and he couldn't have been friendlier on arrival/departure. Our two girls, 6 & 8 really enjoyed the space, especially the snacks in the hanging baskets and waffles.  The neighbourhood was full of energy. and it was nice to stay somewhere relatively untouched by tourism.  The area felt very safe and it was surprisingly quick and easy to get to and from Downtown. There is a great coffee shop on the same street and Michael had some great recommendations for food.  We hope to come back sometime.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place—comfortable, nice light, great location, not bad for a couple of kids (3 and 5). Joan was friendly and helpful. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fort Greene is the place to be on Halloween! We had a nice stay in this lovely apartment, for a week with 2 kids. It is just like the pictures. The layout is as described and worked fine for us. Annie and Joan were really kind hosts and responded quickly to our texts. We had an issue with the heating on the first night and Annie gave us a heater first thing in the morning. After that it was fine. The area is great - there are parks, shops and subways nearby. It is a really diverse and cool neighborhood. Halloween was heaps of fun here! The place is well stocked with kitchen equipment and linen. It is on a quiet, lovely street. There’s a little bit of traffic noise at night from the Main Street, but it’s not too bad. Great place, thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We found this place after we had already moved out of another airbnb because of some construction gone bad. The pros of Tomer's place: he accepted our last-minute reservation request within moments, his girlfriend who was very kind met us in the middle of her work day to let us in, and the place is quieter than most others in NYC, with the windows overlooking a little courtyard. Though we did not use it, they have cable and a large TV. The neighborhood is pretty fratty, which might appeal to some. The only thing I would have changed is that the place isn't really set up like most airbnbs. There were no wash clothes and no coffee pot--the kitchen equipment in general was minimal. I'd say in my twenties this place would have worked just fine; in my late thirties, I wanted more creature comforts.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tomer has been very helpful all the time but the apartment needs to be updated. The bed is uncomfortable for two, the lights are badly situated and few, the bathtub gets stuck, the rats aré dangerous, the towels and sheets rather old and shabby. Kitchen tools are poor and is not nice to find food in the refrigerador or clothes in the chest of drawers. Aldo the door is old and does not work properly. The price is too high for the product offered.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We loved this place.  Irma is a great host and even answered a text message at 9pm.  The home was clean, well laid out and well lit.  The rooms were comfortable and there was plenty of storage for anything you needed.  We didn't cook while we were there but if we wanted to, everything was available.  We always found parking close by and the location is great and safe.  It is on the 3rd floor so make sure you can navigate some steps.  We went to the city twice and it was not a bad commute by train at all!!  Would highly recommend this rental to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Marshall was an excellent host right from the beginning. We exchanged several messages before the arrival date, and he was very clear about directions, and offered helpful information regarding parking options. There is a very reasonable parking garage only a few steps from his building. (He was very patient with us when we initially went to the wrong building and called to ask him where he was!) Marshall also checked in with us via text several times, to see if we needed anything- which we appreciated. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Marshall is a very nice guy and was an excellent host.  He made me feel very welcome.  The accomodations were very clean and comfortable.  The room is small but was completely adequate for my purposes.  The bathroom down a short hallway was also spotlessly clean and had a great shower.  The drinking water is excellent.  The bed's mattress is on the softer side.  I have a bad back and would have preferred a stiffer mattress but, in fairness, I expect my wife, who likes a softer mattress, would have loved this.  The apartment is in a great part of town in a good neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was my first experience in airbnb and everything was perfect. I felt comfortable, the apartment was clean, tidy as illustrated in the application. Even, the host provided a lot of recommendations of bars, stores and subway. I didn't have any bad experience and I would strongly recommend to new guests. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Andy and Frank are wonderful host! Andy greeted us at the elevator and made us feel at home as soon as we walked in. He showed us our room and welcomed us with chocolates and sparkling wine. Their place is right next to the subway stop, the Q train will be your best friend if you are planning on spending most of your trip in the city :) And the commute isn't bad at all. It was very kind of them to provide coffee and breakfast every morning. The bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom was nice. They were accommodating to everything and gave us a lot of privacy. Overall, we had an amazing stay and would recommend to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We hebben een hele fijne tijd gehad bij Andy en Frank! Je verblijfplaats is op minder dan 3 min wandelen van de metro. De Q train brengt je naar Manhattan in 30min ongeveer. Er zijn ook veel andere verbindingen met de Q train. Beide heren zijn zeer gastvrij en wij hadden direct een klik. Wanneer we “thuis” kwamen konden we ons verhaal kwijt en dat was fijn! Alles was tiptop, je krijgt een kamer met een privébadkamer die prima in orde is! De kamer is niet heel groot maar je hebt genoeg ruimte. Wanneer je langer dan een week blijft kan je wel niet alles stockeren in de kamer. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The community at 345 Eldert is super cool. Ota's apartment is badass and the space you get includes a lot (including a view of Manhattan). Ota is very flexible and communicative when it comes to amenities & check-in/out. Would totally stay here again. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Highly recommend this hidden gem down in Sunset Park. You can walk 7 blocks and jump on the express trains which will have you in Chelsea in about 20-22 minutes which was awesome for us! We know Brooklyn pretty well but never get to this ‘hood. Joaquin and Jon’s home was BEAUTIFUL! Very thoughtfully decorated and our bedroom was he perfect size. Also, our bed was comfortable, sheets were extra soft and there was an Apple TV setup so we could enjoy Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc. The 3rd floor skylights are also so nice and I don’t think (though I could be wrong) they made it into any of the listing’s pictures! Such a nice stay. Thanks guys!</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>This Airbnb-place was the dirtiest place we have ever stayed in. It looked like the room - and the bathroom was even worse - wasn't cleaned for weeks. There was a lot of dust and hairs on the floor, especially in the bathroom, and the dishes in the kitchen weren't clean.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The photo of the room is accurate. It's really hot in NYC these days though and it gets awfully stuffy in there. The bathroom is not clean. the shower drain was super clogged with hair. Bedroom linens were not very clean either. There was no mention of bottled water as is mentioned in the listing. Although, Chris seemed like a nice guy, he keeps to himself for the most part. Nothing's wrong with that, but in case you're the type that likes to get to know the host, you should probably keep looking. I would recommend staying at his place since it's within an hour's train ride from Manhattan and fairly priced. You do get what you pay for however.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een hele fijne kamer, echt super voor deze prijs! Christopher is een erg vriendelijke man, hij is super behulpzaam, geeft veel tips en is oprecht geïnteresseerd in zijn gasten! De badkamer en keuken waren simpel, maar hartstikke prima. De buurt was niet heel mooi maar er zijn een genoeg winkels om wat eten/drinken te kopen en je bent snel bij de metro. Al met al een geweldig verblijf in NYC gehad!  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The bedroom is small as described. Very clean and comfortable. No bad surprises at all. Great and complete kitchen and a confy coach to relax after an instense day. The rest of the place is huge. Daniel is an excellent host, caring and very nice. Great price for what you get. I recommend it 100%.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It can be a good choice/value, it depends on one's needs. I hope this will be helpful, here is what to expect (the goods and the bads) if you decide to rent it:\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>De ontvangst was soepel. Beatriz dacht ook mee aan vervoer vanaf de luchthaven. De ligging is rustig maar wel vlak bij de metro en wat winkels en ontbijtplekken. Je deelt de badkamer met de eigenaresse. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We spent one week in the end of april at makini's house. The apartment was confortable, well decorated and quiet. The neighboorhood is safe and the subway is very close to makini's house. We had no bad surprise except that there are no shutters or thick curtains in the bedroom so you have to use a sleep mask or wake up with the sun.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kini's place was cool. It is an old house and sound travel. I gave my stay a 4 because of the internet connection. The place doesn't have cable so I purchased SlingTV to watch the game and other channels other than Netflix. But the connection was so bad it kept going in and out. Even while I was doing a little work the internet went out a few times. The host helped but we gave up after a while. The couch and the bed is uncomfortable but the blow out bed worked fine. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This Airbnb was overrated in the reviews. The photos are misleading. It looks like the photographs but only to a certain extent. The home is not as done up as it looks. The appearance of the bar cart and “breakfast bar” in the photos, doesn’t exist. This apartment is much smaller and older than it looks on the website. Pest control appeared to be a problem. Saw many things crawling. Cleaning was definitely rushed or seemed to be. The lack of a clean bathroom was a problem for me. This apartment also takes longer to cool down more than likely because of it’s age. It was almost like the air wasn’t working. I was told to use a fan outside the door, that wasn’t actually there. I was sweating in my sleep. The overall location of the Airbnb wasn’t too bad, but not what I expected. I would have preferred staying in a hotel to get the experience that I thought I would get from this Airbnb. The Uber code in the details for the free ride you have access to when you book doesn’t work. I was referred to Uber to figure it out. Nothing came of that. Upon entry in the home, it looks like people are moving in and out with all the furniture in the hallways. You have to clean up upon leaving, like take out the trash on your own, clean out the fridge, etcetera when you pay a cleaning fee, which you would assume would cover that. I didn’t understand that part at all. The person I communicated with seemed nice and tried to be helpful but overall I was disappointed from the time I unlocked the door. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice host but really uncomfortable stay so we had to leave after two nights. We only got refunded 50% of our 7 night stay which was really disappointing because we only stayed 2 nights and left after we found there were a host of cockroaches in the kitchen. Aircon kept cutting out and cleanliness was very poor. We then had to find alternative accommodation in NYC last minute. First bad Airbnb experience, think we'll be sticking with hotels for a while.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We really enjoyed our stay in this sunlight filled oasis in Brooklyn. This is the perfect place for a family, with a very nice playground just around the corner of the street, Prospect park zoo just a few blocks away and the Brooklyn children's museum. The apartment is tastefully decorated and very cozy, we just felt like home :-). And Shawna was always available to answer my numerous questions, she gave us a lot of info about the neighborhood. Too bad, we didn't stay longer! We'll definitely come back :-).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Definitely a bad experience , the apartment is dirty, her cat lives in the bathroom, the whole apartment smells really bad</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I and my friend felt really comfortable staying in his house for 8 days. As the dates we stayed there were Christmas holidays, we could stay more restfully even like our house. We were able to cook in the kitchen and there were enough cookers and dishware to use. The location was not bad but it should be considered because it takes about 40 minutes to get to the center of Manhattan by subway. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Frank's apartment has exceeded my expectations. It was really clean, has a comfy mattress and all the necessary things you need for one week accommodation. Frank left plenty of food in the fridge for us such as fruits, orange juice, cheese, etc. The underground is 5 min walking and it takes you 20 min to get to Manhattan. The neighbourhood was really safe and I didn't see nothing wrong or felt afraid. Frank's partner speaks Spanish so she gave me some useful advices about the house and the neighbourhood. The only bad point is that the flat is located in a big avenue and there are car noises early in the morning and maybe could disturb you sleep if you have that kind of problems. I definitely will stay again in Frank's accommodation when I come back to NY. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was really cute, the kitchen had everything we needed to make a meal or two though we mostly ate out. Frank stopped by one day to see how we were doing which was really nice of him. We spent most of our days and nights wandering and not much time in the apartment but it was comfortable while we were there! It was about five minutes walk to the Franklin station which wasn't bad at all, and there was a grocery store and laundry mat right around the corner so  we definitely were close to everything we needed! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gabriela was very kind, we arrived very late because of the bad weather on the road and she was waiting for us and welcomed us warmly. She made us feel at home instantly. The flat is very cosy, clean and convenient. It is just 5 minutes walk to 103rd station (Subway 6 - green line). We loved discover the neighborhoods of Harlem too, its lovely restaurants and jazz clubs.You can reach the center of Manhatan very easily and quickly. We will definitely recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Amazing location, seriously can’t be on a better block. Very good value for $, the roof is amazing, very clean, big bathroom. It is on a 6 floor walkup so beware with luggage but honestly not that bad! Great experience. Right next door to all the best restaurants and bars in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It is a bit off the beaten path if you intend to do most of your activities in Manhattan, but for the price you can't go wrong.  It is a about a 20 minute subway ride to the financial district as described.  1 hour to Yankee stadium and at least 45 to Times Square or Central park depending on the time of day.  That was accurately represented in the description.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Check in was super easy and the house was clean. When we arrived, the house was freezing and took until the next day to be warm enough. Luckily Adam had a couple space heaters on hand as well. The wifi worked great and the house was exactly as described. Be prepared to walk about 10 minutes to a subway stop. Not too bad if its nice out! I recommend bringing your own pillows if you're picky like me!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This ia first time to use airbnb,so i was nervous  a little bit.but Qian was kind and the room was clean and comfortable. I could get the station for easy. Nyc subway was not bad and i used 7 days pass (: i enjoyed Nyc stay because Qian and her house were helpful and comfortable. See you again!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Robert and John are real super hosts. We loved our stay here! I used Airbnb a few times during my trip but this experience was different. A lovely restored old house in a gorgeous neighbourhood. I can recommend this place to everyone who wants to explore the city and live in beautiful area. IT IS AMAZING!!! It was my parents first Airbnb experience. They had a blast! You can't go wrong with this listing. Thanks again for everything John & Robert! You were great hosts!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Well what can I say our perfect home away from home. Very clean in a great location. From the time we got there to the time we left it felt like family both Rob and John are great. They always had a answer and they were always available and full of jokes. It was nice to get a little background when we got there instead of here's your key see ya bye. Location is great and perfect and public transportation is not that bad as everybody says. We want to thank both Robert and John for being such great hosts definitely will refer them to other people. Definitely will stay there again. I highly recommend this place for anyone who decides to visit New York.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay. Our host left a lot of information about the neighborhood and where to find things. The apartment is cozy and comfortable for four people. The apartment was very clean when we got there. There is plenty of cooking equipment, towels, blankets and pillows. There is some street noise and noise between floors, but not too bad. It did not make our stay unpleasant. The neighborhood is amazing.  There are a lot of good restaurants and it's close to two train lines. It's an easy walk or jog to Ft. Greene Park. It's a very quick train ride to Williamsburg. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We arrived quite late and Drew was there to greet us with a few bits and a welcome note for our stay left in our room, which was very sweet. We then had little contact with either Drew or Jenny during the two weeks, except one or two short, but polite conversations iniated by us. The room was cosy, and the whole apartment has lots of nice vintage bits and bobs which was cool. It's close to the subway and easy to get most places quickly (weekends it's a bit of a wait for the subway, but maybe i'm just hard to please after 5 years on the london underground!). There are not many places to eat nearby we found, but lots of convenience stores. The rooftop is amazing, now it is coming in to summer it will definitely be the place to hang out and cool down in the evenings. We loved the two cats, quite difficult to shut those cute faces out of the room but they do leave a lot of hair on your stuff if you don't! Nice to have them there to greet us after long days walking in the awesome city that is New York though! As people have mentioned previously, because of the cats Jenny & Drew sleep with their door open, which is fine but it is hard to be sure whether they are home and you are disturbing them in the mornings/evenings. The internet went down at one point toward the end of our stay, Drew was away and Jenny was unable to get it connected again (as the account is in his name) and it was three days before we were able to use the wifi again. As we were mainly planning our days the evening before using the internet this was pretty inconvenient but we managed (Starbucks is never too far away!), and Jenny was apologetic. We were hoping for a bit more insider information about things to do New York, but the internet was actually more helpful! Speaking of which the Mac which was mentioned in the description wasn't there, which is fine for us as we used our phones, but should maybe be removed from the listing. All in all we loved New York, but we got the feeling we caught our hosts at a bad time! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Drew was easy going and a gentleman. Great communication for my arrival and the keys. The room was perfect for a single. Comfy cozy clean bed. Needed my sleep mask for morning sleep ins.  The sun is bright thru the windows of the bedroom but thats not such bad thing if you are an early riser...kept me going :) Excellent use of the kitchen before heading out for the day. I enjoyed it there very much. I felt comfortable and relaxed my whole stay. The rooftop for me was a bonus. You can see the skyline of manhatten from there. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sue's place is excellent for the value! Nothing too crazy and it's more of a hostel with private rooms but still good nonetheless! None of the other air bnb guest were out of line/too loud/unenjoyable so I'm happy to say we got lucky on that end. Also I don't think the fridge is appropriately cold as we had some food go bad, but not a big deal just something to be weary of!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This apartment is a treasure.  Only two blocks from the subway station, and super clean.  It is nicer than the photos show.  Entry with a lockbox key with clear instructions making check in and out very easy.  The area is extremely diverse in its population.  I found my spot for French pastries and fantastic coffee only one block away, so every morning it was very easy to get up and have my coffee before I started my day.  I found the area to be very safe.  You must try Angela’s, a Caribbean restaurant only one block away with a whole page review in the New York Times.  I actually got to meet Angela in person - loved that little restaurant.  Can’t go wrong with this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great place! Clean quiet and cozy! Awesome lil touches such as bagels, bananas, grapes, juices were left for us.  Great location and quick responses.  You will not go wrong here!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"Having successfully used Airbnb many times traveling in the U.S. and abroad, I was a bit anxious about booking a stay in a private bedroom listing. I usually stay in a complete  apartment listing where the host is not present and you have the whole apartment/home to yourself...but Carrie's reviews and the price were so good I decided to try it. I could not have been more wrong about being anxious... This stay was definitely one of the highlights of my Thanksgiving theatre trip to NYC!! Carrie's 2 bedroom apartment is set up just right for privacy and is  a lovely home from the furnishings to the cleanliness to the pretty park right across the street and finally to the very safe, nice neighborhood in which she lives. The transportation on the \"\"A\"\" express train is so easy</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wij hebben een geweldige week gehad in New York mede dankzij het verblijf in het appartement van Carrie. De kamer was erg netjes. Ook de keuken en badkamer waren schoon. Ook het ontmoeten van Carrie was leuk, een erg vriendelijk en behulpzame vrouw. Zeker een top locatie voor een verblijf in New York. Een rustige buurt aan een mooi park met het metrostation op nog geen 5 minuten lopen. Zouden zeker weer voor dit appartement kiezen! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>nice little apartment, ideal for two people.  we were three, so it was a bit tight with the luggage.  everything necessary was available.  Nick was very helpful and gave us good advice.  The apartment was in a good location for exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan.  the subway was a short walk away.  If you did not want to walk the bus stop was around the corner.  a small minus for the apartment being a bit dark, but since we were out all day it was not that bad.  We felt very comfortable there.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Gary's place is as described in the listing. The decor is tasteful and everything worked well (apart from a small hiccup with the TV). Its a funky space and is large for NY standards. However, the apartment is noisy as its literally on 7th Ave so you need to be prepared for this (it was worse for us as there was both work happening on the building during the day and gas road works on the street during the night). This is obviously not something Gary can control but it would have been good to know about the building work in advance.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gary’s place was a bit of a letdown. When you think West Village, you think brownstones and tree-lined streets. This was not that. Additionally, I feel the place was misrepresented in the photos. It looks very different in person than it does online (on a bad way). Sorry Gary, but this is my honest feedback.\n</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Terrible host, terrible communication, terrible attention to detail.  He ignored repeated questions about check-in & cleanliness problems; from the time of our arrival, we heard nothing from him despite several attempts to make contact.  To make matters worse:  the key to the unit was not in the lockbox; when I called for assistance, he didn't answer.  When we finally got to the unit (well after listed check-in time), we found a cleaning crew there - they told us they'd need an additional 90 minutes to clean.  Stephan was completely unavailable during our entire stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I was lucky to find a place in New York on New Years Eve weekend! The train isn't very far away. I liked that I was able to listen to music on his badass speakers! I felt at home. Check in and check out was easy. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kevin is very welcoming and has a positive, warm apt. Made sure that we had everything we needed and more. He was very patient with us unpon arrival, as we had an encounter with some bad traffic coming in. Once we arrived he gave us a great tour of his apt, ameneties and a heads up about where it was ok to park. And ensured us we were safe, which it was. He was very responsive with anything we needed afterwards. Love the bathroom and everything was clean. Our stay was so great and I highly recommend Kevin.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I think this place is generally not bad. I didn't like that she didn't clean the floor of the room at all. I saw tons of dust under the bed which made me so uncomfortable.  Also, she doesn't seem to wash the duvet cover that's why I only covered my body with very thin linen. Jime wants the guest to fit her schedule every time. I understand how busy she is but at the same time, I feel pressured as she slightly pushed me to fit me in her schedule for check-in. I even helped other guest's check-in as she was not able to do so. Also, she tends to be selective when it comes to answering the guest's question. I personally don't understand this because if she doesn't know or doesn't want to answer she at least should let me know but she just ignores my message. I feel like she tries to be gentle but in her mind, there are lots of thing going on which proves she doesn't really care the guest much as she tried to be shown to others.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Place was fine, 5 bedroom, 2 bathroom. My stay there were four other people using Airbnb, all very nice, just unexpected. Lots of rules, made to make living with strangers easy, but some felt excessive. Place is in a good location and is a good size. It’s on an avenue and above a bar but the sound wasn’t too loud. Some good and some bad but fine for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Steve is a very responsive host both before and during the stay - he responded quickly to messages before, and only once was his response delayed, when it turned out we had the wrong number for him via the listing. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Saint is a wonderful person and deserves an excellent mark. But I still appreciate the convenience of housing for travelers, not the owner. The district is good, you can walk at the lake in the north of Central Park. Many places to eat. But there is nowhere to eat well. The subway goes downtown and to the ferry almost from the house. Respectable building. The owner is very friendly, on the first day he even gave me a bottle of water. A room with a bad door that does not close. But no one disturb to sleep. Slightly uneven mattress. The most uncomfortable place in the house is the bathroom. Because of the automation water flows badly. No towel hooks. Shower can not be direct to yourself. In the room at night the clock is noisy. But there are European plugs. In general, I am satisfied. Thank you, dear Saint, sorry for the true.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I read one pretty bad review about this place and I was a little hesitant to book, but I did anyways since it was such a short trip. After staying for a couple days, I don't understand that negative review at all. The place was small (which is obvious from the post), but nice and clean. It has all necessary amenities and more. The host was also extremely helpful and responsive when I had lost key details in my e-mail. Great experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This apartment is ok about the interior design but there are several problems : that's very dark in the evening in the area, the sound absorption is too bad and the quality of the mattresses is not at the top !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Don’t book this Airbnb. The photos and description aren’t accurate and it doesn’t seem like they have been for at least a few years. The furniture is very tired and old, there are chips and marks and scrapes on everything - walls, furniture, floors. The leather couch is so badly damaged that it was covered in a bed sheet when I stayed. The TV turned off and reset every 15 mins or so. The beds have old, poor quality mattresses that sag badly and are uncomfortable. We had to prop them up with spare pillows. The place wasn’t clean when I stayed. The kitchen sink’s drain stank and flies seemed to be coming from it. I bought a fly spray to get rid of them. The bin smelled awful and I had to clean it with bleach. The crockery, cutlery and kitchen cupboards (inside and out) were grimy and gross, so I didn’t use them at all. The bedsheets had stains on them and I had to piece together a single cleanish set from both bedrooms. The hairdryer was filthy so I didn’t use it. To add insult to injury, the ‘cleaner’ turned up before I had checked out and was still packing - I’m unsure why, as the place was so unclean when I stayed. If you’re looking for a party/student style flat and don’t care about any of this, then go ahead and book. Otherwise, avoid this Airbnb unless it’s your only option. You could do much better for the money in Bed-Stuy.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Meghan was a very welcoming host that helped us out with anything we needed. She was accessible if we needed her to be, otherwise she respected our privacy. This was our first time renting an individual  room with air bnb and will not be our last. We usually rent out the entire place because we were unsure of noise volume, restroom, privacy, ect but we were wrong. It's an awesome way to save money while traveling to a big city.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Meghan will make you feel like home when you are with her. And her place is the COOLEST! She has such beautiful, unique decor in her home. You CANNOT go wrong by staying with her.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very accommodating, clean home. Close to the ferry, great place to stay. Only downside is I’m a light sleeper and the neighborhood can be a little noisy. But no bad words about Meghan’s home, it was very cozy.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>El piso muy limpio. Elliot muy atento a nuestras necesidades del primer día al último. Quizás esperábamos el piso un poco más grande y con el mobiliario diferente en el salón, ya que no había la mesa de comedor que figuraba en las fotos, pero las instalaciónes eran buenas. En la cocina había para hacer café y te y además labadora! \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sylvia's place is great, smaller than what it looks in the pictures but still OK for 2 people. It is close to a couple of subway stops and it is close to some good restaurants. Sylvia is so helpful and will respond to any queries very quickly. The only downside is that the Wi-Fi was pretty bad, now I know we were on holidays and weren't there that much but it made looking up trips and directions pretty difficult. All in all it's a great place to stay</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>great place.  awesome neighborhood  and Julie is kind considerate   you can'tgo wrong staying at Julie's</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Michael was very accommodating in meeting me to hand over keys and show me around. The place was very spacious and clean. The backyard is really pretty and a nice place to chill out. The location is great, I went back and forth to Manhattan on both days and it was really easy. Great restaurants in the area too. The only thing I would mention would be that the neighbours do play a lot of music. The noise is not so bad in the front room but from the kitchen and bedroom it was noticeable. Admittedly I was there on a Friday and Saturday night so maybe they just had a social weekend.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Josh is good at contact before and after the booking, and is on the spot for the check in.  I checked into this site on March 27th as scheduled, met with the host and things were generally set. However, I noticed that the place was fairly warm and discussed it with the host who said the radiator in the room could not be turned off a (the listing refers to “the radiator is being controlled by a person in-charge and the AC is being controlled by the host”).   That code seems to mean that the only ways to attempt to moderate the heat are to open the window or use an AC unit under the window.  I left for the evening to attend events and returned to the room finding the heat level in the room something like a sauna. I could not lower the heat to be able to sleep at all. I tried opening the window but the street noise was quite excessive. I tried using the AC unit but it operated so loudly that it was worse than the street noise as it was constant.  The bed is on the opposite side of the room from the radiator, window, and AC unit.  Since the underlying reason for the heat was the radiator that could not be turned off (or even down), there was no real solution to this situation. In the middle of that first (and only) night in which I could not sleep at all due to the excessive heat I realized I could not spend another night there. I had to leave the apartment early to attend the convention that brought me to NYC, and when I could break away in the afternoon I returned to get my suitcase. I informed the host that I was checking out because of the excessive heat preventing me from sleeping, and his response was, “OK.”  I think it's very bad on his part to advertise a place that has this uncontrollable source of heat in the room without a proper advisory on the environmental situation.  Fortunately I was able to secure a hotel on short notice for the remainder of my stay.  The primary purpose of booking a bed via AirBnb in NYC is to find a somewhat inexpensive place to sleep at night, but that was not the opportunity at this location.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>the good things about this apartment are certainly the access; being on the Greenl subway line is the best place to be in Manhattan, and it's actually quite good if you're in NY for a while to be a little out of the centre. it was also great for driving upstate.  i personally find Harlem fascinating too.  and Tae was communicative and responsive when we needed anything. BUT romantic this apartment definitely is not.  the neighbourhood is definitely the most confronting part of East Harlem, and the walk to the subway station takes you past permanently stationed police cars (day and night) and you are regularly accosted by people on the way to the train. also the Met overground line runs day and night 100 metres from the flat and is VERY noisy, along with several large construction sites on the block. the internet signal is so weak it's unusable in the living room, and you have to sit on the bench in the bedroom to have a decent connection.  there is no proper table in the flat to have a meal, and you certainly can't invite anyone around (we have family in NY). furniture etc are really serviceable but i'm afraid Tae is cutting corners where he can and the plastic wine glasses are just ridiculous given the price you pay for the place.  it also seemed inexplicable that walls and cupboards and so on are only half painted, but that doesn't interfere with the stay.  it's also the most expensive AirBnB i've done (but that's okay, the price is fair for NY) but it's also the only one where there was NOTHING on arrival, not a small bunch of flowers, not a couple of pieces of fruit, nothing.  for a two-week stay, that was wrong. i'd like to be more positive (see my other reviews, but i'm afraid i can't). if Tae addresses a few of these matters, which can easily be done, the place could be okay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The host was very responsive when we had problems getting into the apartment with the security code key. The area / location of the apartment wasn't too bad but it would have been nicer if it was closer to a subway station.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay at Carmia and Joes apt in Brooklyn. The place was spotless, the localization great;  quiet,  but close to subway options to easily get in to Manhattan. Carmia and Joe responded immediately to every request we had, and offered a solution whenever one needed. We didn't get to use the beautiful garden due to bad weather, but I can imagine it is very nice and peaceful place after a busy Manhattan day. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>When we first arrived we were a little concerned by the location and the proximity to the subway. I know that in the UK there have been occasions when you (perhaps wrongly) feel uncomfortable when you are clearly in a community of which you aren't a part. The local shop area feels a bit run down but the residential property gives the impression of being a little more affluent than the shops. The subway which is above ground is regular which means the noise of regular.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Trish een heel vriendelijke gastvrouw, ze is heel leuk en zorgt dat de gast een aangenaam verblijf heeft! Ze heeft me geweldig geholpen met alles: tips over inkopen, dingen die in de stad te doen zijn, uitgaansgelegenheden etc. Op de kamer was alles gereed, inclusief wasmiddel en handdoeken! De foto's liegen niet: het appartement is echt geweldig met een simpele maar goede keuken, badkamer, eetkamer en huiskamer. De locatie is zeer goed voor iedereen die bij Columbia University moet zijn, of in het algemeen in New York wil zijn. Dit appartement is een absolute aanrader!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Ehsan's listing is accurate, and he was very communicative before we arrived. We had no significant issues. Location is just 5 minutes from the subway station. Note that the second bedroom is located in the basement floor, which is accessible through a small, spiral staircase. My parents would not be able to walk down those stairs, and so they took the upstairs bedroom. Nothing wrong with the basement level bedroom – it's very spacious. I just could be a problem for older guests.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Melody was nothing but a warmed host. She helped me with anything I needed. The room is exactly as described, you will not encounter any bad surprise. ;) The area is ok -to me- even if I didn't get back to the place late at night (just once, and nothing weird happened). The place is perfectly close both subway stations. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is clean and the hosts are amazing! We had a bad experience with another host in the area and were left scrambling for another place until 7 pm on a Saturday night. They helped us out on really short notice and were really friendly. I would definitely recommend staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Let me start by saying that I will never stay in a Manhattan hotel again after staying at Ella's home. At first I really thought something has to be wrong with this place, but after all the great reviews I went for it and could not have been more satisfied. Everything you see and is described is 100% true and our rooms were amazing! Ella was just beyond words, a truly a gracious host. I had told her we would be there by 1230AM but didn't get there until 230AM but she was right there to greet us at the door! Very pleasant to interact with, and if we needed help with anything she was more than glad to help. Now the apartment, it was literally nicer than most hotels, bigger than most hotels, very well kept, clean, and aesthetically pleasing. Ella even provided a few things that we just did not expect, truly an amazing host (will not spoil it for yall) literally only thing you really need to bring is toothpaste/brush, shampoo, and clothes. She also provides you with a large amount of information about venues around NYC, sights to see, places to eat, etc. The neighborhood is very safe, quiet, and at no time did I or my 3 friends (1 male, 3 females) feel in danger at all (we would come home 3, 4, 5AM). Having never been in Brooklyn previously, I am wondering why I never did because this area is awesome, honestly prefer it to Manhattan. Hope to be back soon!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Miss Ella's Brownstone was amazing. We rented this location for 2 weeks and we are a family of 4. We had 2 bedrooms and a pull out and we LOVED our stay. We had the opportunity to go out local or go out and explore and we did both. Christmas in New York was fantastic and being able to cook a southern meal in Miss Ella's Brownstone will be one of my forever memories. Thank you for being such a fantastic host and we LOVED your local bar The Treehouse. If you want to be welcomed and feel you are family and not just a guest then this is the place for you. You cannot go wrong with this Brownstone; it is 5 minutes from the subway, minutes away from GREAT restaurants, and a neighborhood that is welcoming. Miss Ella is a fantastic guide and will get you to where you need to go. If you want a TRUE NY experience then you will seriously consider the Brownstone. Miss you Miss Ella</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>You will find Ella’s place inviting, comfortable and her street and brownstone entry clean and nicely appointed.  Her furnishings are top quality and she left us fruit, juice, water and wine.  There’s street noise at night with the bedrooms in the front, but that’s just part of staying anywhere in NYC.  Felt badly for her when it was discovered her hot water tank no longer functioned soon after checking in.  She bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of, offering for airbnb to either relocate us or refunding a portion of our nightly rate for inconvenience.  We were lucky to have our son’s place to shower so we chose to stay for the whole reservation and had hot water for our last night.  She was genuinely apologetic for this unexpected event.  Her local tips and maps were helpful and we loved our dinner at Eugene and Co., just a few blocks away.  We would definitely return.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Laurent was very nice and always answered our questions. The studio is very cosy and warm, no bad things to say about it!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Madeline was absolutely lovely and always ready to help. But the studio is not in Williamsburg, it appears to be nearer from Bushwick than from Williamsburg, so a bit far away from Manhattan. Furthermore, the bed sheets and the kitchen utensils were in pretty bad shape.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Carlton's place is a very good alternative to stay in NY,  being just 2 blocks from metro system, and about 15 min from Penn station. There's good bad and laundry so you can every night take a good sleep and have your clothes clean and fresh to discover a little bit more of NYC in the next day</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tamara's place was clean, well-located, and an excellent price! The unique neighborhood was filled with loads of character, and Tamara herself was very welcoming and accommodating. Even though a problem happened at the end of my stay which was entirely my bad, Tamara remained uncommonly courteous and friendly. One of the best hosts ever--highly, highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great location, space exactly as described, comfy bed, and brilliant rooftop. Martin is super lovely. He kept to himself most of the time, but was helpful with food/drink suggestions when we asked. You really can't go wrong with Martin's place! I highly recommend it. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Martins place was very industrial and rustic. That is exactly the reason why I wanted to book his apartment while I was in NYC. My girlfriend and I was enable to check in until late, but Martin was nice enough to coordinated a check in time that works for both of us. The location is very close to the L train, which made our trip so much easier in NYC. The room is clean and has enough room for us to walk around. For any guests that wants to stay in Brooklyn for a reasonable price, Martin place might not be a bad choice!  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Martin’s home was clean and just as described! Bed was so comfortable too! It’s his home first and you have to respect that as a traveler because he’s honest and this is a private room in someone’s home. There are two train stations, one is 4 minutes away and the other is a short 10 walk. A lot of places to eat and explore in the area. I have nothing bad to say about my stay and would recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The stay was okay, nothing great, however nothing terribly bad. Bedroom is in the middle room, no window</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is very nice. We had bad luck, because workers have been working on the street changing the water pipeline. Due the lack of water service, we leave the apartment earlier, buy Zev understood the problem (it was not his fault) and he has responded quickly to find a solution.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great space. Enjoyed staying here. Super close to the subway. Key pickup is close by. As far as the lack of kitchen - you are doing NYC and East Village all wrong if you are cooking meals in your Airbnb! Many thoughtful touches - wash cloths, for instance - a rarity for Airbnb’s!  Only minor caveat is totally out of the host’s control: there’s a building under construction across street that for two of the three mornings wasn’t a big deal. But one morning they started work around 7:25 with the backup beeping from construction equipment. Not a big deal for me since I had to be up for work anyway, but if you intend to sleep late make sure you use the handily provided earplugs next to the bed. (Its a quiet street otherwise and very mellow at night).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great little pad if you are not looking to eat in. Very disappointing not to have a kitchen or 2 seperate bedrooms we were looking for & used the search engine to find. Great location as far as subway but the people in this street being the homeless locals congregating opposite, a little disappointing but given so much homeless in New York any wonder. Overall not too bad as we didn't hang out but rather just slept there. Very expensive bed & couch.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I would definitely stay here again maybe without my daughter. The location is super convenient. It’s a shorty walk to soho and Chinatown. The place was clean and spacious. My only advice is that the front bedroom (where the front door is) is very loud at night. I think because where it is located you hear all the drunk people walking down the streets and coming and going in the building. Apparently the middle bedroom isn’t so bad (with the noise). The TVs in the apartment also didn’t work during our stay, it turns on but couldn’t watch anything, the host says the remotes probably needed batteries changed. I wasn’t too concern since we didn’t go to nyc to watch TV.  Overall great apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Had a very pleasant stay at Marie's place. Neighborhood was quiet & peaceful. About a 30 minute trip straight to the city on the L train. Plenty of delis, Chinese, & pizza spots for food 2 blocks down the street. House was clean & there were clean towels & sheets when we got there. Everything was as described, & for the price you can't go wrong. I would definitely return here again.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>When we first checked in we were in a rush so we just dropped off our bags. It was extremely hot and damp... But I thought if I would put on the ACs, the dampness and smell would go away upon our return from dinner. That was not the case when we returned around midnight. The apartment smell worse and the AC in the kitchen did not blow cold air. We began to further inspect the apartment and noticed mold in the bathroom grease on the stove and a sticky substance on the countertop. The floors were sticky an extremely Dusty around the corners and the smell in the air smelled as if the place had been bombed for roaches... Which made us cough. We could not stay there that night or any other night. My fiance and I spent hours trying to find a vacancy at the overcrowded hotels near JFK. We finally got a room at 4 a.m. at a cost of $209 a night. It was too late to contact the host Marie that night, so I waited till just before noon to send her my message that we would not be staying. My message was polite and to the point. I have yet to hear back from Marie with any resolve of a refund.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The host was lovely and offered to let us use any baby items they had spare as we had our 1 year old daughter with us. But the place had a bad smell. We also had troubles getting in and out of the driveway when they had their car parked there. We had to lift our pram over the car which wasn’t a real issue until the day we had to leave. My husband had to climb the fence and I had to lift our suitcases, cot and pram over my head to pass them to him over the fence.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Marie is a GREAT host. she was very accommodating. Her place is nice and comfy. it is a basment apt but i seen none of the things mentioned in the other reviews. place smelled good and heat was about 73 so.i had no issues. Parking can be a bit of a challenge but marie is very helpful with her drive way if needed. Good 20 days you can not go wrong with this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Chandra was the perfect host - a great balance of being willing to help and answer questions without being too overbearing. Her place is exactly as shown -- very clean and feels like a home. She offered us complimentary breakfast each day and helped us plan out our adventures whenever we needed it. If you are hesitant to stay due to the reputation of the Bronx, just know that Chandra's place is about as secure as could be. With plenty of locks and an effective home security system, her home is about 100 feet from the subway station which helped us to feel safe coming home late at night. The commute to Manhattan or anywhere else is about 25-30 mins which isn't too bad but can get old during a visit of more than a few days. Having said this, with the overall experience of hosting, cleanliness, safety, and value, I would highly recommend staying at Chandra's place. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jeevan was absolutely an amazing host and a real gentleman. He got me city guides prior to arrival and welcomed his place to me as if it's my own. He was kind enough to suggest a few places to go to and the bad areas to stay away from. I would absolutely stay with him during my next visit again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed at Cathy's place last week (August 5th 2016), but only for one night, instead of 4. We had to move out rapidly because there were mice in both bedrooms. Since my mom and I are afraid of them, we packed our stuff and escaped to a hotel same night. That was a horrible experience, we had to check our bags for the mice, book a hotel in a rush and run away. Beside that, the apartment is very nice, bright and comfortable for the family of 4. It has all the amenities and kitchen utensils that you might need. The neighborhood looked a bit sketchy, and it didn't feel safe to return to apartment from Manhattan late at night. There is nothing to do around too. We were glad to move to the hotel that was located on Wall street with (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with the host was good, move in and move out process with no problems. We got refund for nights not stayed and Cathy apologized for our bad experience.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great space here. Close to train, walking distance to great coffee , restaurants . Safe neighborhood , eve late at night. The apt itself is clean , full of light, and comfy. Easy to get in and out with keyless entry. Can’t go wrong here .</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place! A bit out of the way, but not too bad. Cathy is very nice and respectful.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Everything was exactly as the pictures showed, It had everything we needed. It was easy to find and safe to walk to anywhere you needed to go. Lovely neighborhood and beautiful apartment! You can’t go wrong with picking this place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Super verblijf gehad bij Atlantis en Carmen. Perfecte plek om New York te ontdekken. Superbed, ruime kamer (wie komt er naar New York om op zijn kamer te zitten ?). Keuken en badkamer worden gedeeld met Atlantis, maar zij is heel vriendelijk en dus leuk gezelschap. Als we terugkomen, dan graag hier!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We agreed that this would be our final try with airbnb after several bad experiences and it was fantastic. Isa is the best host you could ever want. She made an early check-in possible for us, the house is beautiful, the neighborhood is very nice and the room gorgeous and clean. Isa made a wonderful breakfast for us every day, getting up only for us and we had the best coffee here on a seven week journey! I would recommend Isa to anyone and we would come back anytime and if only to catch up and meet her again as she is a lovely and extremely interesting person! If you stay in NYC, come here and be amazed :-)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sam was a great host, so nice and welcoming! Have nothing bad to say about her or the apartment at all - great location, a lovely space with plenty of room or us to stay comfortably for the week. Great experience all in!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was open and airy.  The apartment, including the bathroom, was clean, although I thought the shower curtain could be replaced and the toilet flushing pressure was a bit weak.  The door to the bathroom does not give complete privacy.  Abundant sunlight came in the windows in the morning, which was both good and bad.  The sunlight was nice, but it was hard for those in the living room to sleep with the bright light in the morning.  The regular bed in the bedroom was comfortable and the light was not a problem there.  Don't expect a picturesque view from the window.  It looks out to the building next door and a trashy area between the buildings (but that's just typical NYC).\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not sure how it is possible Samantha has perfect reviews. I've stayed in many air bnbs and I'm not particularly picky but this place was downright dirty and falling apart. I think she promotes it as artsy, but the place is coated in dust as well as stained/dirty linens, no toilet paper, terrible bed, fixtures in bathroom falling apart, no bathroom door, and walls that are paper thin. The place is located in a building that could be condemned any day with missing dry wall through the the halls and exposed wires and pipes throughout the building. Location is also extremely inflated in reviews. On a corner that is not trendy and hipster as advertised, but instead dangerous and ghetto. This is the only bad review I have ever written but I think it I owe it to possible future tenants to know what they are paying for. If you want to experience great food which is always one of my goals, get a different place. The only decent restraint around was the Rookery. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Unfortunately we did not get to stay at Samantha's loft due to bad weather and our flight cancellation to the East coast. Samantha was understanding and courteous considering the difficult circumstances and the touch and go situation for a couple of days prior to our arrival date because we were not sure how the predicted storm would develop. Although disappointed not to go, we still hope to stay there another time. Airbnb customer service was also great helping us with resolving the cancellation policy issue from their end.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Samantha’s loft is a great place. A little out of Manhattan, but not really far. Amazing restaurant around the neighborhood. The only thing that kinda suck was during the weekend the L train was down due to maintenance BUT it had nothing to do with the loft. The other subway station was only about 10-15 minute walk which wasn’t bad. The loft is a great place for a relaxed vacation.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Ruth and her family made us feel like we were part of the household.  We had fresh-ground coffee waiting for us along with breakfast choices every morning. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was exactly as pictured, if not even better than the picture suggested!  We had no problems with other guests who were as courteous as our hosts. The home is beautifully furnished, but it was a real home, not a museum. The location is perfect for anyone who wants the essential NYC experience without the drawbacks:  we had no parking problems, were in a lovely neighborhood, and comfortably close to transportation centers, shopping and good restaurants. After having a few \"\"bad hotel\"\" experiences</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Perfect for our needs. Such a lovely and welcoming home and hosts. Neighborhood is safe and wonderful as well. We simply don't have a bad thing to say! We never dreamed we could feel this \"\"at home\"\" in New York! \"</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>If you are looking for a place to call home during a visit to NYC, you can't go wrong staying at Ruth's place in Forest Hills. Any of the three bedrooms are comfortable, and use of the common areas: living room, tv room, dining room, and kitchen, truly make you feel as if you're staying in a family member's or friend's home. The master bedroom has a comfy king bed with an unbelievable bathroom. We were spoiled using the fantastic shower and jacuzzi tub! Our son and daughter-in-law enjoyed the ensuite bedroom with the queen bed and wonderfully private attached sun room. Finally, the bright and cheery double bedroom has a nice-sized hallway bathroom for its use. Each morning, you awaken to freshly-made coffee and breakfast items such as bagels and English muffins at your disposal. Having a driveway in which to park up to three cars is a big plus so you don't have to hassle with on-street parking. The closest subway stop is a few short blocks away which will connect you with anywhere you wish to travel in the city. If you catch an express train, you'll be in Times Square in about 30 minutes! We made two trips to JFK airport, which is only a 12 minute drive with no traffic (not counting time spent trying to pull up at the arrival terminal...have fun!). Austin Street with its great variety of restaurants and shops is a short walk away. It's also nice to walk in the more residential section of Forest Hills where the former U.S. Open stadium is located. Even though the house is located near the highway, the school next door buffers the noise, so it's very quiet at the house. One day, we even walked to Citi Field to watch a Mets game. It's about an hour walk, which takes you through the old NY World's Fair grounds and past the current U.S. Open Tennis Center. Do not hesitate to stay at Ruth's place for a visit to the Big Apple!\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>If you are looking for a place to call home during a visit to NYC, you can't go wrong staying at Ruth's place in Forest Hills. Any of the three bedrooms are comfortable, and use of the common areas: living room, tv room, dining room, and kitchen, truly make you feel as if you're staying in a family member's or friend's home. The master bedroom has a comfy king bed with an unbelievable bathroom. We were spoiled using the fantastic shower and jacuzzi tub! Our son and daughter-in-law enjoyed the ensuite bedroom with the queen bed and wonderfully private attached sun room. Finally, the bright and cheery double bedroom has a nice-sized hallway bathroom for its use. Each morning, you awaken to freshly-made coffee and breakfast items such as bagels and English muffins at your disposal.

The location is unbeatable, just over a block to Central Park and countless restaurants in quick walking distance.  There is also a great movie theatre literally across the street!  It was the perfect place to stay with kids, safe and easy to get to.  It was a quick taxi ride to Broadway and so many other fun places we visited.  We unfortunately stayed during a crazy heat wave and only one of the AC units would work at a time but she did have 2 portable fans we were able so it wasn't so bad.  The couch bed was also only really suitable for children but it worked for our situation!   All in all we were so happy in our stay and the location and would absolutely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The appartment is definitely accurate to the description. Very easy to go to Manhattan from this place in Brooklyn (Kingston subway station is 2 min walk away). Marcus even had his cousin deliver us the keys because we arrived very late and he wasn't available so no waiting at all. We also had an extra couple hours for the check out because I remembered the exact time wrong. I strongly recommend this place which fits 5 people easily and even 6.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>If you want an awesome host and a very authentic NYC experience, Christine's place is it! It's in the perfect location, surrounded by more restaurants and coffee shops than you could hope for. Christine was so nice and hospitable. I visited with my parents to tour potential grad school programs. Christine provided some food to start us off and toiletries in case we forgot ours. Felt very safe. Amazing view from the fire escape. Apartment is a great size for 3 people. Like a previous reviewer said, maybe not best for two people to sleep on the pull out couch. Would work for one adult or two kids I think! The couch is also a little uncomfortable, but not unbearable. Maybe not best for someone with a bad back. Over all, great experience! Thanks, Christine!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Christine's apartment is awesome. It's in a beautiful area of Greenwich village surrounded by local shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. The apartment is in an older building for NYC, but there are zero issues with Christine's place and the age of the building adds a cool bit of charm. The apartment is above a bar which can be noisy at times, but Christine is very transparent with this issue (she is a great communicator) and even provides a white noise machine to combat the sound for when you're sleeping; I really didn't think the noise was that bad though. The bed and the couch are both very comfortable, the apartment has some cool art hanging on the walls, and like I said some old school charm. All in all we had a great time at Christine's place!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I never met Matthew, I spoke with him over the phone a couple of times. Everything was well organized and I did not need to meet him personally. The apartment was very clean and we loved the location. I really cannot think of anything that I felt was wrong. Thanks Matthew.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This experience is not so happy overall. When I booked the place, Larry told me that there's no room and he has a place instead of this for me, I thought the one he recommended will not be too bad since that apartment is his sister's, so he definitely know the condition. However, when we arrived there, the room turned out to be by the roadside and on the second floor of a pub. Big noise until very late of the night. Indeed, we haven't asked him whether it will be noisy at night. But this is the most basic thing for finding a place to sleep in so it should be included in its ad. All in all, I just want to say that the reason we choose airbnb is that we think here people are more honest and friendly, so please don't ruin our trust.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nora, Christopher and Brian were extremely helpful, I was able to book at the last minute after having to cancel my stay at another place due to a bad experience. It was totally different dealing with them, they were friendly, the place was clean and looked exactly like the pics. I would surely recommend them and stay again! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice location, clase to La Guardia, only bad thing We had to check in after 5pm.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Angelo offered to meet me since I arrived very late on Saturday, but I arrived at the wrong time due to customs going quicker than planned. His friend let me in to the house and helped with my bags so there was no trouble. When I met Angelo the next day he was very welcoming and nice. The room itself did not look like the picture, so do not be surprised if you are in a different place. I think he has multiple Airbnb listings. The room itself was a good size and the bathroom & kitchen were okay. There were snacks on the nightstand upon my arrival, which was nice since my flight was quite late and I was too tired to find food in the area. This place is approximately 7 minutes walk to the station Astoria/Ditmars, which has the N & Q trains. They go directly to Manhattan but be careful with timing - the trains only come once every 15 minutes. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Although I ultimately just used Angelo's place to sleep as I was out by 7:30 am and home at midnight), I still enjoyed my stay. The room is spacious, clean and bright. The bed is comfy. Full access to kitchen and bathroom. He has roommates but you can still have a quiet experience. The place is a 10 minute walk from the closest subway station, which is not too bad. It is the last stop on the N/W line, which can get you almost anywhere. Neighborhood was quiet and diverse, with lots of nearby coffee shops/restaurants. Angelo was also super accommodating with my check-in/check-out time and checked with me to see if I was settled in fine. Overall, great value for the price and would definitely stay here again! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Angelos place isn’t bad; lots of restaurants and bars nearby. One train ride away from Manhattan. He was very clear about rules and things to lookout for.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I initially thought I would be quite far away from everything, but it was a short bus ride to Williamsburg and then a short ride on the A into Soho. So travelling in and out really wasn't too bad at all. Steve was really, really hospitable, always willing to give tips if I asked. I was in and out doing my own thing most of the time, but I got the feeling that if I was traveling by myself he would have happily included me if he had something cool going on. The apartment itself is very nice and clean, with 4 other rooms including Steve's own room (bedding, towels and soap was provided too!). 2 clean bathrooms, so wasn't waiting around for people to finish using them all the time. There is a kitchen/common area to chill in if you need it too. All in all, a pretty chill place to stay and easy to get around especially if you plan to hang out a bit in Brooklyn (which I did).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Angelo's apartment.  He was there to meet us on time when we landed, and was very kind and patient with us.  The place was decently clean, but their were a few problem areas for me.  The apartment is pretty close to a lot of the local/diverse  restaurants which helped out a lot when your tired from walking around NYC all day and all you want to do is hang out and get a bite to eat.  The apartment was really close to both the airport and subway stop.  Maybe an 8 min walk to the subway.  $25 round trip for a taxi, to and from airport, I don't think is a bad deal at all.  All in all, if you're there to see the sites and spend a lot of your time in Manhattan, Time Square, etc.  and then have a place to crash and get a nights rest and a hot shower, then this place is perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Verten var lett å kontakte og akkommoderte våre behov med innsjekk og utsjekk. Rommet var veldig lite for 3 personer, særlig fordi vi hadde en god del bagasje, og renheten var ikke helt på topp. Vi kom sent på kvelden, og den tredje av oss kom enda senere. Vi bar kofferten hennes opp trappen og måtte flytte litt rundt på koffertene som sto på rommet for at alt skulle få plass, og da ble en av naboene sinte og vi fikk en klage på bråk. Utleier sendte mange meldinger og sa at naboen truet med å ringe politiet og vi ble informert om at Airbnb faktisk er ulovlig i New York (det var ikke vi klar over på forhånd). Denne opplevelsen var litt ubehagelig og vi syntes naboens klage var veldig urimelig, da vi hadde vært så stille vi kunnet og hvisket og virkelig prøvd å ikke bråke (i tillegg til at det var et veldig kort tidsrom). Så hvis du vet at du ankommer sent, ikke bo her. Anbefaler heller ikke å bo her hvis dere er 3 personer med mye bagasje. Vær også klar over at det er 1 toalett og 4 rom med 2-3 mennesker så totalt er det mange som deler bad (vi hadde ikke noe problemer med det).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Telmo’s place felt safe and secure. He was very responsive to our needs with or without me contacting him first. His home is cozy, the kitchen is stocked, and the common space has a good selection of entertainment! It was about a 5 min walk to the bus to get to the subway, but overall 1hr-1.5hr on metro to get to Brooklyn, Midtown, or Chinatown. It is a little hard to get groceries if you need them, but overall it’s not a bad area! Would stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The place was great. We had a few issues with the faucets being wrong and since it was fall, we kept finding leaves everywhere inside. I would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gary’s place was perfect for our needs - spacious, clean, great location - just what we wanted. The deck must be great in the summer - you can even see the Freedom Tower! Might not suit out of shape guests as it’s a 3 story walk up stairs - tough after a long day of sightseeing - but no problem for mildly fit people. It’s totally as described - actually bigger than I thought it was going to be. Great neighbourhood with everything you need just a quick walk away - including Manhattan! Too bad you can’t use all the bed space, but there are plenty of options. I’d be happy to stay here again if I’m in Brooklyn in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My first time using Airbnb was a bad experience. I booked this and then was told to cancel it because it was sold out. I was told to call the company and lie to them so I could receive a full refund, because the host didn’t want to have to pay their cancelling fee. Don’t plan on using this anytime soon.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our host sounded very friendly on email. Too bad she said she was busy and coulden’t come and meet us, we had to go a 10 min cab drive away to get the keys. She always comunicated with us via mail, probably was away at the time.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stefanie's airbnb is part of a bigger apt complex. Theres an elevator for those who dont feel like walking (its not so bad). The apt itself I found to be clean. I didnt meet the host on check-in due to schedule differences, but the process was fine. The kitchen has everything you need. Living room was spacious. And 2 rooms I found to be decent size. I noticed though for one of the rooms the ceiling light wasnt working, and the only light source was from a tiny lamp. I had read other reviews stating how dark the apt was...yes, it was at times. We didnt spend a lot of time inside, so I guess yes not a ton of natural light. There are post-it notes all over the apt referencing where to find things/how tos. Stefanie's roomate is the person who I communicated with & she was helpful. They listed out their numbers & made it known they were available for any issues. My stay was 2 nights, the times I did have questions the response was timely.  We ventured out to nearby neighborhoods for our stay.  The apt complex itself seemed sketchy at times- it was a Saturday night & Halloween weekend when we checked in- so Im sure it may have been livelier than other nights- you can hear music from ppls rooms. The halls smelled of weed at times. Again- nothing the host has control over but if youre looking for a place for a family/young kids not so sure if this is right for you. Overall good place. I think the neighborhood was ok-just enjoyed the close proximity of the park.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a lovely time at John and Catherine’s. They are great, welcoming people and the space was ideal. It is nice to have the private bathroom and there were lots of nice touches. It really way close to the subway too - 40 mins to Downtown. We also found a nice neighbourhood coffee bar with great staff (Taszo). Location is a little noisy at night - though not at all bad by New York standards and the fridge does hum a bit (as you’d expect), but all in all a good experience. Thank you, John and Catherine!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was a good little apartment in a fantastic location – and good value – but the communication was poor. After making the booking, Susan (the host) asked me for my email address, and she emailed me information about meeting someone called Ray at a Starbucks café. I replied with my arrival time and asked whether it would be OK. This was a month and half ago and, after more emails from me, I still have not heard anything from Susan. Before arriving in New York I sent a text message to Ray and eventually got a reply – he did not know who I was! He also said that I had been given the wrong meeting place and should meet at a different location. This left me rather apprehensive when I was on my way to New York, not sure whether the listing existed or not!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Velma was a great host, she made my group of six feel very welcome. The area was nice and quiet not much foot traffic. It's about a 15 minute walk to the A/C or G train which isn't too bad. The neighbors were all really friendly as well. The apartment suited our needs perfectly and I would definitely book again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was dirty and in bad repair.  We canceled in the middle of the reservation asking for a refund and the host was uncooperative but Airbnb gave us a refund based on the pictures we sent showing the state of the apartment and how dirty it was with crumbling tile in the bathroom, broken floorboards and exposed electric outlets.  I do not recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very convenient location to many parts of Manhattan. Really interesting part of the city with a lot of things going on. Door lock to the unit can be a little tricky but not too bad once you get used to it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>RENTER BEWARE! There is no Jeremy & Laura. You are booking with NYC Short Lease. (Hidden by Airbnb) them and read their horrible reviews for yourself. This unit is NOT a 1 bedroom, but a converted studio with a poorly installed thin wall, 12 inch gap at the ceiling that separates the bed from the couch. I wish I had known all this before booking.  NYC Short Lease has absolutely no care for your time, comfort or well being.  Filthy apartment and check in was a nightmare. Here is a list of items I had to buy because they were not provided and when requested they said they could not provide: ice trays, a bath mat, a clean rug, a new mattress, dish towels, hand soap and dish soap. Sometimes I had to wait days for a response to my concerns. The old, uncomfortable, stained mattress is on a box spring on the floor with no actual bed frame. The couch is ikea and should be in a waiting room for the DMV. There is no decorations.  Way too over priced for the value. This unit is above the building's dog park and kids playgrounds, and the windows so not block the noise.  The unit itself is the corner closest to the fire department so you will hear sirens all day and night. The blinds do not block any light. The heating was noisy and unreliable. I had to buy a heater in October because they didn't turn the heat on until it got down to 45 degrees at night. I stayed in this unit for 3 months, but was too busy with work to start looking for something else. I had booked a unit of theirs 2 months prior.  I flew 11 hours to get to NYC and on my cab ride from the airport to the building, Suzy called me and said there was a leak and water damage in my unit and that they would have to move me to a different unit. I waited about 30 minutes for Jessica to arrive to the building to let me in. The unit was filthy and it was obviously a storage unit for extra furniture for all their other apartments.  TWO DAYS LATER a maid came to clean the apartment. That same day I had them empty out half the furniture so I had room to walk. I told them my frustrations and concerns from day one and they didn't care and did little to fix anything. This is my first bad Airbnb experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed at Rez's place for a weekend at the end of September.  I was visiting NY with my husband, and we had the place to ourselves.  The apartment really is huge, and it's decorated with very cool, funky decor.  We especially liked the poster above the sofa.  We had a minor snafu with getting into the apartment, but Rez was very fast at responding to my SOS text, and we were in in a matter of moments.  Communication with Rez was great, the apartment was great.  The neighborhood was mildly sketchy coming back at midnight, but not too bad (I might have felt differently coming back late at night if I were alone, though).  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This appartament is perfect for young people who are looking for something clean and cheap. The appartament is far for Mahattan but the subway is in front of the appartament and with it you can go everywhere. The room and the private bathroom are small but very clean , and the bed is very comfortable. The host provide to you with towels and soaps. The appartament is small but very well equipped. The neighboorhood is not bad, loudy and a lot of people speak spanish. Inside the room the heating make a terrible noise but if he can fix it the appartament will be perfect. The host is very kind ans he help you all the time.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was clean affordable central located which was easy to get around not a bad neighborhood </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We hebben een prima verblijf bij Ian gehad! Het is inderdaad zoals beschreven, inclusief tikkende verwarmingspijp maar hier raakte ik vrij snel aan gewend, en sliep ik doorheen. Wat ik wel vervelend vond was dat de kamer wel een raam had, maar dat er geen daglicht doorheen kwam. Gelukkig had de kamer airco, het was ontzettend warm in het appartement. Wat superfijn was, was dat we een eigen badkamer hadden. Ians appartement is 5 meter van de metro af, wat heel fijn is. Je zit in east-Harlem, best wel een stuk van alle toeristische attracties af, maar doordat je meteen de metro instapt ben je er toch binnen een half uur. Ik zou deze locatie zeker aanraden als slaapplek! Wanneer je verwacht meer op je kamer te zijn zou ik gaan voor iets met daglicht en iets meer ruimte, maar omdat wij er alleen waren om te slapen was dit echt top!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>He was drunk when he came home and reacted badly when (was also drunk in this situation) we wanted to tell him we feel not safe in this neighborhood (drugs, rough...)...he has not responded to our apply to cancel the second reservation because we do not feel safe and this does not feel like holiday...we have canceled without refund (we‘ve booked before the other room for the rest of the stay, because the room with the own bathroom was only a few days (Website hidden by Airbnb) not book this...Furthermore when he came home he has made a lot of noise so we thought someone wanted to break in, we were really scared...even though when the price looks at first glance really nice! \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Seemed a great price for the neighborhood. Lovely home, and not a bad view! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>No bad surprise but a lot of good surprises !!!! A very good place and Amitai help us to spend a very good week !!! The best place i had !!! All you need is présent !! Again thank you Amitai ! I hope we will come again !!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"5 star host, 3 star accommodation. I want to start off by saying Wilma is fantastic, she is a wonderful person and an excellent host. The apartment is ideal for someone looking for the essentials. It is definitely \"\"cozy\"\" in size. There are minor issues such as broken tiles and it gets very hot during the summer. Anytime anything went wrong</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was not bad. The location was also good, close to a lot of things. One drawback would be the price, its a bit too expensive. We stayed with Jemima. She is very kind and a good host. She made us very comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Very prime location & very gracious host, enjoyed my stay.You cannot go wrong staying at Tony's, highly recommend for all.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was the most negative and bizarre experience I've ever had on Airbnb and while I can't say for certain someone else would have the same experience, I would strongly recommend NOT taking the gamble.  Here are some pertinent facts about my exchange with the host:  One, the address provided on the listing is fake. Even the street is wrong.  The explanation I received is that he did not want his landlord to know about the Airbnb rental. Take that for whatever it's worth. This would not have been a problem for me if I was given the real address via direct communication after we were already talking, but that never happened, and the whole thing felt sketchy and misleading. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I absolutly loved my stay at Ian's house. It was very clean and the bedroom was big. The apartment was close to a Subway, so it was easy to move around. Ian was hospitable and easy with the check in. Didn't see him much but I could always contact him if there was something wrong. Will definitly stay here again! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It’s a good stay. The location is not bad. But I didn’t get any body wash. The major problem of the room is that it doesn’t have sunlight. So it’s kind dark in the morning and you don’t know what time it is if u don’t check ur phone. David is good guy, enjoyed talking with him and his good coffee.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>2 of my friends & I stayed at marlana's house for 2 nights when we arrived her husband met us & let us in he was great he showed us around the apartment & let us know where everything was! They made us feel welcome & very comfortable! The view from the apartment was so beautiful we could see the city & the water! The neighborhood wasn't bad & the subway was right around the corner! We had a great time in New York & we were very glad to stay where we did!! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This great couple, Marlana and Matias, and their beautiful place made our NYC trip just perfect! They are professionals! We had very unpleasant experience in the other Air B&B place for the first two nights in New York. We decided to move out and started searching a new place on the second night. It was late night when we found this place and sent them a message. Surprisingly enough, they replied us right away and organized everything very quickly to receive us next morning. How relived and relaxed when I arrived at their place! Even though their previous host had just checked out, the room was already ready for us. How impressed I was to see the organized guide book for guests! It helped us understand how to use their place easily. And their place was even more beautiful than it looked on the photo. The awesome panoramic view of NYC from our room and the living room was simply bonus to our trip. I've visited New York several times before, but it was the first time for my daughter, Sam. I was afraid if the wrong start would ruin her trip. But she could quickly forget about the terrible experience and fully enjoy the the rest of the trip thanks to this wonderful and thoughful host. I also like to thank you Marlana and Maria for the nice organization with their friend for their absence while our staying. My only regret was not to have enough time to talk to these wonderful people. When I visit New York next time, I will surely contact them and check if the room is available. Thanks Marlana and Matias!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Chuck was very responsive and polite in his messages. He hosted us at the last minute for our flight from JFK in the morning. Even though we arrived late at night due to the bad weather, he waited and welcomed us warmly. He made us feel like home and even got us some treat from Donkin Donuts. The apartment was very clean and warm. The kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom were equipped with most essential items. The apartment was very near the JFK airport (within 15 min by Uber) and walking distance to the subway station. However, at the time, the nearby subway station did not have an elevator for people carrying heavy luggage or bag. Overall, we enjoyed our short stay at the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Great location, nice clean place, nice building, easy check-in and check-out, neighborhood not bad. The host \"\"Chuck\"\" was very nice and prompt in communication. Recommended!\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was my second stay with Kevin and Ryan, and I have to say that yet again this is an AMAZING airbnb! Kevin and Ryan are amazing hosts, they made me feel like I'm a roommate that they've know for a while :) Communication was great! And let's just talk about the apartment... the view is STUNNING(even the bathroom has a great view!! lol) Everything in the apartment was very clean. There's also a fully equipped kitchen. The best part is the location! Its only a minute walk to Times Square with lots of food and entertainment options. It's also only three blocks from a major subway line(if you're flying in from JFK all you have to do is take the air train and get on the E subway and you're there! So easy!!) Only thing to note is that if you're a light sleeper that doesn't like light or sound is to bring and eye mask and ear plugs(it's really not that bad, but like I said if you're a light sleeper) I can't say enough about how amazing this experience was! If you want to feel like a New Yorker in the heart of the action this place is for you!!\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>My stay with Kevin was fantastic. I knew exactly where to show up, had all of his contact details ahead of time in case anything went wrong (which it did, my bus got delayed), but Kevin kept in touch with me throughout the evening until I arrived. He and Ryan offered some great tips about where to go and how to get around. Their place was very clean, I had total privacy staying in the living room space. And you can't beat the location. I'll definitely book through them again next time I'm in New York. Thank you for everything, Kevin and Ryan!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>If you are looking for a place to stay out of Manhattan, that is still as close, this is it. Mario is an absolute gentleman. We arrived quite late in the evening when we stayed, however Mario still came out to greet us and assist with getting a parking spot. He then took us up to put our bags away and took us on a small tour of Brooklyn heights, explaining all the good and bad places to eat and drink. The accommodation was perfect for us. The subway is a 5 minute walk, which is only 1 stop from Wall St and Uber is cheap as well to get into Manhattan. The layout of the house gives you and Mario plenty of privacy, you have the kitchen and bathroom in your area and Mario has a door closing his section off. I have no doubt if I am back in NY, I will attempting to book Marios place again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was my first time using Airbnb, and it worked out exactly as I had hoped.  Brooklyn Heights was my childhood neighborhood, and this trip was to introduce my sons (ages 10 and 11) to both Brooklyn Heights and Manhattan. I used Airbnb to try to save money on accommodations and defer those savings to experiences (restaurants, musicals, museums, etc.).  Mario's room was exactly as described, and his warmth as a host was accurately reflected in the many reviews I read here before booking the room.  Our daily schedule was typically along these lines: We would awaken at 7:30 or 8:00 each morning, then each shower/dress for the day. There is a fantastic bagel shop for breakfast directly across the street, and we would eat there after I started a load of laundry conveniently located in the basement of Mario's brownstone. I would time the completion of breakfast with the completion of the laundry, fold the clothes, run back up to the room and then we would depart for the day.  During our 5 day stay, Mario was always in his quarters (well separated from ours) each morning until after we left for the city around 10 a.m.  One block over is a beautiful promenade deck that overlooks the NY skyline. We would follow this deck and make our way to the walk-over access of the Brooklyn Bridge. After the 1 mile traverse of the bridge, we were in Manhattan for the day.  I planned each day with different events from that launching point. We went to the 9/11 Memorial, Times Square both at day and at night, walked 5th Avenue, visited Chinatown and Little Italy, walked the Highline, visited Central Park, visited museums, say School of Rock the musical on Broadway, ate way too delicious NY food and so much more.  We mostly got around by walking and using the subway (subway access is also very close to Mario's apartment, and I found that Apple Maps on my phone was perfect for turn by turn directions both walking and using public transit). Mario was extremely helpful when asked for specific information either in person or by text, and went out of his way to ensure our comfort.  The best example of this was his offering for us to stay an additional night when it became clear that our return home was going to be greatly disrupted when Delta cancelled 3000 flights this weekend due to bad weather in the southeast!  We loved this trip, and I recommend this large room and living area to your family as home base when you visit Brooklyn and NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Erika was a very good host. Reasonable easy to park.  Location is a little off the beaten path but its not too bad. Subway is nearby. There is a citiBike station 1/2 block away and a few blocks away is another bike staton in front of the free public swimming pool.  Also nearby is an actual beer garden, and a few blocks over is an excellent greek dessert place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was a real pleasure staying at Justine's place. I got into the city a little after midnight but Justine stuck around to welcome me and share with me some tips about Brooklyn (check out La Caye for good Haitian style brunch). Her apartment is very spacious and comfortable. Enjoyed her Netflix and Pandora after a night of hitting up the bars. She lives in a safe neighborhood and is about a 5 minute walk to the metro. It takes about 30-40 minutes to get into Time Square area but not a bad commute to Manhattan. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a chill place all to themselves, that's in a safe neighborhood, and is within striking distance of Manhattan. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall my daughter and i were very pleased with our stay. The apartment was very clean and we enjoyed having our own little space. One of the things that caused a minor problem for our trip was that when we arrived, the elevator was out of service. The elevator had been out of service for 2 months before we booked. I have bad knees and my daughter recently recovered from a broken ankle, we booked this space because of the elevator. So when we arrived and found ourselves with a 4th floor walk up we weren't very happy. Thankfully two days into the trip the elevator was back into service. When we arrived we had a mix up with getting our keys. She had told us we couldn't arrive until after 1pm, we had arranged to drop out luggage off with a friend uptown because we weren't going to be aloud to come earlier. Just before 1pm we received a call from mariella, because she was expecting us at 1pm. It wasn't anything that hindered our trip, just found ourselves running around town. The only thing that stands out to me were that the pillows on the bed were terribly flat. We bought pillows after we arrived. Other than that the location was perfect! Very close to the subway station and quickly could get anywhere. I would stay here again and would recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Absolutely wonderful. Susannah is very personable, friendly and hospitable.  My kids and I truly enjoyed staying at her place. Highly highly recommend. I thought with no AC we wouldn't be able to handle the heat but boy weree wrong. Being from the South and our temps in triple digits during visit it was actually a break. Very nice breeze and with the fans made it perfect and actually kinda cool at night.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Jeff & Jessica are very kind and super helpful with any advice on getting around the city. If you’re looking for a fair price for a great place to stay in NYC, you won’t go wrong choosing this spot.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Great location. Unfortunately there were some problems. These were made worse because the host was in Italy and was unavailable. I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because she was having health issues and was in the hospital and it was difficult for her to communicate.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It’s super bad I try to book the apartment this weekend and not available</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is a super clean, tidy and modern home. Too bad I didn't stay here finally because of my personal issue. But it definitely a nice place to stay. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het was een nette kamer, met eigen badkamer ter beschikking.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We hebben een ontzettend leuke tijd gehad in New York. Dit kwam mede door het geweldige verblijf in het appartement van Kumudu en zijn gezin. Het appartement is zeer netjes, de kamer waar we sliepen ruim en de privé badkamer was heerlijk. De familie is erg behulpzaam in het ons wegwijs maken in de stad en hebben ons goede tips gegeven onder andere waar we konden eten. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Monifa and Saint were amazing hosts. Checking in was smooth and so was our time there. The key broke and it was replaced by the end of the day. The apartment is clean and comfortable. The bed and pullout couch are all in one big room, which we didn't realize. It was okay though, since it was a nice ladies weekend. Be aware that the pullout couch wouldn't be good for someone with a bad back.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>What a great stay, nice appartment and nice neighbourhood. 10 min walk to Nostrand subway in the center of Brooklyn. 20 min to Manhattan by this subway. A fully equiped kitchen, 2 big beds, airco, a fan, a clean house, a bathroom with bad/shower even a garden and Bbq! Everything we needed. Ariela en Javier were super friendly and helpfull. Javier, we wanted to say goodbye to you and thank you for your help and good ideas but you had already left the appartment. : )</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Matt and Katie are fantastic hosts and really good people. This was my first Airbnb experience and I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it would be awkward being in someone's home, but Matt is one those people who puts you so at ease, you feel like you've known him for a long time. Matt met me personally for the check-in, and did everything to make my stay as comfortable as possible. Matt is a great communicator and did a great job explaining Airbnb to me, and was responsive to my texts and messages whenever I needed to reach out to him. Given the circumstances of my visit to NYC and my schedule, I hardly saw Matt and Katie, but they were there when I needed them. The location is close to the subway and quite secure. The surrounding area is not bad at all, and sits between Little Italy and China Town. Matt's place was exceptionally clean and organized, and is exactly as pictured right down to the awesome model ship. It's a cozy apartment that has that classic NYC character, and it reminded me of where I grew up in upper Manhattan. He's such a considerate host, he even provides ear plugs if street noise happens to bother you - which there was hardly any. If I have to return to NY in the future, Matt's place will definitely be the first place I look for accommodations.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ok, I'll start off with this apartment is exactly as advertised . Me and wife loved the authentic Brooklyn feel was what we was looking for. Very close to multiple eating locations short walk to the L train for fast access into manhatten road 3 times. Walkable to restaurants, bars and great corner stores. The apartment was comfy and cozy the bed was amazing . I have no bad things to say just a few adjustments that would have made my stay even better and hopefully for the next person behind us. 1. The trash was not emptied in the kitchen in both trash cans 2. There was a mini fridge that looks like it has not been clean inside for months 3. The front door key is getting difficult to open the door with. 4. There is was no wash clothes or iron provided. These are very minor adjustments Chloe can make for next guess. Overall I would book again Chloe answered all questions quickly and the apartment is very quiet nobody running or stomping . Thx again </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Check in was a breeze--super flexible with the time (flight and transportation delays are getting worse getting into Manhattan -- Patricia made it super simple!)\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time in this apartment. The position is very convenient, a few minute by walk from metro stations 2,3, B and C: it was so easy for us to reach the city center! Moreover the neighborhood is very quiet and it seemed to be safe. We found the house very clean, cozy and comfortable. We only had some difficulties using the internet because of the very slow wi-fi connection. Anyway this problem wasn't that bad for us because we were there for holiday and we didn't need the internet for important things such as work stuff.  After all, our stay at Patricia's apartment was great and I would surely recommend it to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dette var mit andet ophold hos Hector, og jeg håber også at kunne bo hos ham i fremtiden. Dejligt at have en hel lille lejlighed med bad, køkken og masser af skabe, og kvarteret er fantastisk. Der er kun få minutters gang til den store subway station ved Roosevelt Avenue, hvorfra det er nemt at komme rundt til både Manhattan og Queens. Der er også et udmærket fitnesscenter et par gader fra huset. Og Hector og hans far er meget hjælpsomme.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was my first time staying in The Bronx, even though I've lived in Brooklyn and frequently travel to NY, but typically reside there or in Queens. This location wasn't too bad for getting into town, convenient for getting to the nearby transit station and the space is quite large for other places you'd typically find in New York. I loved that there was a fridge and microwave, which was great for my stay of a week to be able to heat up food and such and not have to worry about eating out everyday.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hi!It was the 4th time when I've been in NYC.As well is the 4th time when I've used AIRBNB site for the accommodation.But is only the first time when I write one review.I didn't wrote till now because I wasn't pleased about the previous location and I don't want to make bad things to anyone.But I can't lie and write that was good and the reality was (Website hidden by Airbnb) I'am happy now that I (finally) found a decent place,for a decent price in a decent location.Thomas and Gabi are very friendly and helpfull.When I'am arrived(with many luggages),both of them helped me to carry the luggages inside the (Website hidden by Airbnb) flight was at 10 pm and they allowed me to keep the luggages the entire day.Gabi also called a taxi for us( a chipper one) to the airport.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location is the best but we have a problem when we arrived. We were given bad instructions to get into the apartment so we spent a lot of time ( 1:30 h) waiting in front of the house with a boy of 4 yo at 12:00 a.m. The host didn´t answer on time and finally we managed to get the keys. Neighborhood is very quiet but with many options to lunch or dinner.  Garden is out of service because there are several conditional works on going across the building.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Host was very responsive. But thats about it. If I ask question, he will respond. If something is missing or needs fix, host will be in denial mode. I read a lot of bad reviews just before I was ready to checkin so it was a bit late for me to reconsider but it was one of the worst 4 nights I had in my vacation. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Arnab was very pleasant and chatted with me when I arrived. Told me about the area, which was great. The location wasn't bad at all. Thank you for opening up your home.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>No bad surprise, the room was exactly as described. Safe & calm location, near the subway, spacious room, access to 2 bathrooms, coffee and fruits provided, access to the washing machine & drier. Also Garnet is really reactive when yous send him a message!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Verten var blid og hyggelig, og dialogen var rask og effektiv hele tiden. Det var stille i leiligheten, noen som er en stor fordel i dette strøket. Sengen var veldig god, kjøkkenet var OK, men badet var veldig lite og ganske nedslitt. Leiligheten er veldig gammel, og mye av den ikke oppgradert på 100 år. Annonsen sier det meste, men bildene gir et inntrykk av en høyere standard enn den har. Som alle andre annonser gjør.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Zoals verwacht, ruim appartement voor 2. Enige minpunt is de kleine badkamer en dat de douche moeilijk te regelen is. Behalve dat was alles super. Perfecte ligging en geen lawaai (we sliepen met het raam open). Heel veel leuke restaurants in de buurt en verschillende metrohaltes dicht bij de deur.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay at Robs apartment. It is really gorgeous and spacious I would thoroughly recommend. Rob was available at any time to help and kindly left lots of information about the local area for us. There is not a bad word I can say about this place and it's great value too! \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My wife and I were first time visitors to NYC. Rob's Place was perfect for us. It's a little farther north on the island than most, but we found it to be the perfect spot for us. There's a wonderful community in the area. We met many kind and helpful people during our visit. There are several restaurants in the area. We didn't find a bad one among them. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall the place was great, my friends and I had a great experience. The space for 3 people was really comfortable. Everything was very clean. The parking was bad only because of the snow, but Anthony made sure to ride with us to make sure we found adequate parking along with helping us move our things into the space. He suggested a really good food place to us called Manny's and was very easily accessible for everything that we needed. There were also other food places within the area that were in walking distance. The place was close enough to the A, C train which was a short ride to the city. The wife even let us use their umbrella's one of the days that it was raining we were very grateful. Overall I'm sure that my friends and I would choose this place to stay again.  </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We enjoyed our stay! The neighborhood is quiet. Several markets are nearby.  We did discover on our last day that we were walking to the wrong subway station - go to the stop at grand, turning to your right on Catherine. We were using the stop at graham. Our hosts were quick to respond. The space is cozy and accommodating. Highly recommend!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I have to say this place was amazing. The place was bigger than what I thought. The patio was honestly amazing, too bad I couldn't enjoy as much because of the rain. One perk is that it's also less than a 10 min walk to the rainbow bagel shop- which is also great! & other great restaurants aswell. Checking in was a breeze and so was checking out. I promise you, you would not be disappointed. I would stay here again :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We were 4 of us in Kelly's apartment and we filled up very homely and well. The bedrooms are spacious with plenty of storage space and the bed were comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped with coffee machine, tea maker, toaster, etc. The bathroom is small but sufficient, good shower and clean. Too bad that there is no heating in the bathroom and was partly very cold . The heating can also rob you of sleep when it heats up the water.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is in a great location with easy access to the F A and R train. DUMBO has always been one of our favorite Brooklyn locations to stay mainly for the views of the city and the quick access to Manhattan via subway or biking over the Manhattan or Brooklyn bridges. The neighborhood itself has really picked up over the last couple of years, which is both good and bad. Returning to Brooklyn at 7pm on a Friday night to catch dinner with a friend and a popular DUMBO eatery we literally got trapped in the subway! There were so many people arriving for Friday night festivities and with only two gates to go in and out at the station it took 45 minutes to exit. I would avoid arriving in rush hour on a Friday.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very great experience. The flat is very nice and comfortable and quiet. Shahram met us with a bottle of french wine, and the flat got every thing you need to spend a good time (coffee, tea, beautiful view, comfortable bed,balcony, sun...). The flat is exactly as pictured and described. We were 3 with our daughter (16) she slept on the sofa double bed in the office place which is not a real room but it's really ok. Shahram was a perfect host, easy to get in contact for any question... Dumbo is the good place to be. Very near Manatthan and very quiet with shop and restaurant  at 5 mn... Sorry for my bad english but I really like this place and thank you very much ! Super appartement idéal pour trois, très jolie situation près du métro des boutiques et des restaurants. L'appartement est conforme aux photos, la terasse est très agréable et Shahram nous a très bien reçu. Il est disponible et joignable sans problème. Nous avions besoin d'une deuxieme clé ce qu'il n'a pas manqué de faire...Bref si vous prevoyez un voyage à NYC je vous recommande vivement cet appartement !!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Shahram’s home was inviting, quiet, and walking distance to the Brooklyn Bridge. The only “bad” thing I’d have to say is I didn’t get to meet the dog across the hall.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay at Shahram’s place was the best stay out of our holiday (and the other stays were good too)! Firstly, Shahram’s communication was excellent. I felt bad as we had travel problems and were delayed getting to the apartment but he was very accommodating and understanding.  He showed us everything in the apartment we needed to know and left us a bottle of wine which was thoughtful. He also sent us tips on where to go and where to eat. The apartment was at the most a 10 minute walk to DUMBO. The apartment is stunning, it was spotless and it’s very well decorated.   We were a bit shocked as we had never stayed anywhere as stylish but we loved it a-lot! The A/C and WiFi worked really well. We have no complaints and we would love to come back if we come to New York again in the future. \n</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>I booked Jason's place since it seemed reasonably priced and conveniently located in the city. The floors are extremely slanted, and the floor in front of the kitchen felt like I might fall through. The bedroom felt very dusty, and there was no place to put anything down in the bathroom. The toilet paper was very thin single ply, and worse than the ones in public bathrooms.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very dirty apartment, the cleaning was not made for our arrival. The kitchen utensils where sticky and unwashed. Every drawers (kitchen and bathroom) where dirty and fulled with stuffed that seemed acumuled over the years. Downstairs (the bedrooms) offer a very bad smell of humidity, it’s like living in a cave. A part from that the host kept coming in the appartment without asking us, making laundry of her own during the day using the washing machine and the dryer, and didn’t even have the decency to take her things back afterwards. Since the soundproofing is very bad and she lives upstairs we could heard everything. Wasn’t worth the price, wouldn’t go back there.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Julia's place was absolutely lovely!! Super clean and spacious, as pictured in the photos. It was an easy check in however the in app map showed the wrong location for the place then what was written and there was a little confusion finding it but other then that it was perfect!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Krzysztof went over and beyond to get me the keys, being that he wasn't in NY to greet me.  We were both in California at the time and he met me to do the exchange and tell me a little about the neighborhood.  The location was easy to get to and from the airport.  My daughter and I had know trouble walking the neighborhood.  The actual condo was just like the pictures, one of his neighbors even helped me with my luggage the first night coming in because there is no elevator...he in the 5th floor.  Everything you need in the apartment is there, and if it's not there are great stores such as FoodTown not too far away.  You can get to and from the city via subway or even cheaper take the Ferry for $4 each way.  Williamsburg is a up and coming neighborhood, very hipster, you can hear things going on all night but it's not bad at all.  Would def. stay here again!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Appartment was great ans perfect size for family with children have a big nice bedroom and mid size room and nice living also it had a very big yard but didn't use it bcs of bad weather \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The house was exactly what we expected and hoped for, location was great for us. Only issue we had was we were given the wrong lock box number on the listing and had to wait an hour outside to find out what the correct code is.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Leslie place was cute and cozy ... We did all of our time in the city,  the bus took about 2 hrs to get to the subway station so we had to uber there each day..this cost us a lot of $$.  Its great if you want to stay in Brooklyn - not to bad of an uber ride to Coney Island.   Thank you again...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>What a nice place to stay. leslie is so nice...too bad we didnt have much time to chat with him.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Edward is a pretty cool guy - definitely not a bad neighbourhood and close to the subway.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Carrie Ann was so prompt and communicative about all our questions even before our stay! She was not in town but had a lovely couple (her friends from Italy) look after the guests . Everything was perfect . The location of the house is so good that we mighty kicked about our choice everyday as we walked out and into the house after roaming around the city all day. Room is nice and comfortable just as we see in the pictures. The cat Lima is a beauty and we loved petting her whenever we found her! Carrie Ann has tips for restaurants around the area and brochures inside the room which were all very helpful ! You can't go wrong with this choice. The neighbourhood was safe and the 24 hour store was such a boon! In the mornings you can try the amazing coffee and scones and other goodies at the coffee shop right next to her house. We are going to stay here every time we head to New York!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We loved Carroll Gardens. Really nice location.  Parking is not bad. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Though we started on the wrong foot, but all worked out. They were really helpful and welcoming :) I sincerely appreciated their hospitality and enjoyed my stay. Thank you :)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I stayed at Lara's place while down for Desertfest NYC and the location was great... only a couple of blocks from The Well and plenty of parking. Great food and beer options nearby, the room was private with a separate key entry, and the space was fine. Lara and her husband were very polite and engaging, and overall it was a very pleasant stay (even if I wasn't actually at the rental all that much). If you are looking for a solid and great valued AirBNB in Bushwick/East Williamsburg, you can't go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We were 2 in the apartment for 1 month. Rachel's apartment is very nice, spacious and clean, it looks like the pictures, no bad surprise. Rachel waited for us for the check-in (we were late) and welcomed us nicely. Moreover she is very organized and gave us papers with all the main informations (WiFi code, restaurants locations…). She was available each time we needed her because she lives upstairs. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay in NY could not has been better at Roger´s apartment. It is really beautiful in a very NY style, we loved it.  Everything was perfect, no bad comments.  In order to make things better Roger sent us the keys of the apartment by post, and that was really important.  The flat is more beautiful than the photos, nice, clean, neat, and confortable.  I recommend  this apartment 100 %, trust me, you will never regret to have been there. We stayed there for eight days. One more thing, the neighborhood  is unbeatable,  two blocks from Columbus Circle. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was as-listed, amenity-wise, although a few less decorations than the pictures showed, but nothing bad!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Pervaiz is a gracious and accommodating host. At the same time, he provides total privacy to guest. The apartment has its own entrance, kitchen and living room. It is very well kept. There is a spacious back yard that we would have used if the weather had not been so bad. The location is within a short walk to public transportation so that you can leave your car parked there and get around Brooklyn (and all of New York City) easily and conveniently.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Apartment was great, really close to the subway, easy to get to. Comfy beds, cozy setup. Parking wasn't bad. Weather was a bit grey and chilly, so didn't spend time in the back garden. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was conveniently located, very clean and comfortable.  We didn't get to use the back garden because the weather was bad, but it looked lovely.  Pervaiz was very helpful and quick to respond when we had questions.  Check-in and checkout were easy...we highly recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lejligheden var rigtig god. Den passede godt med beskrivelsen og der var utroligt meget sollys. Den var pænt indrettet og der var masser af planter. Timothy var venlig til at hjælpe med spørgsmål omkring byen og var nem at få hurtigt svar fra over airbnb. Nøglerne til lejligheden blev hentet på en Deli rundt om hjørnet og afleveret der igen, så vi mødte aldrig hinanden. Kvarteret, som lejligheden ligger i, er med Barbados/Trinidad/Tobago stemning og det er rigtigt rart. Alt i alt en rigtig god oplevelse og god behandling. Dog var der ikke gjort helt perfekt rent og vandet i bruseren manglede nogle gange varmt vand. Der var også en lille ting at hoveddørslåsen var i lidt dårlig stand så man skulle være forsigtig når man låste den så nøglen ikke satte sig fast. Men jeg ville gerne bo der igen en anden gang. Turen med Subway til manhatten tager ca 40 minuter hvilket ikke føles så langt som det ser ud når man sidder der. Der er masser af spændende mad i lokal området. Timothy havde lagt ekstra lagner og håndklæder frem til os samt nogle tebreve i det lille køkken. Det er et rigtigt fint sted, og jeg vil bestemt anbefale andre at bo der.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Description is accurate. Was a nice place to stay while we enjoyed the city. Not a bad walk to the train or places to eat. We bright and sunny and so quiet! The building is older and has a weird smell but there were incense in the apartment so we used those. The bed is super comfortable too!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Folasade was a wonderful host. She answered all my questions promptly and was very welcoming. The neighborhood was lovely as well with a cute coffee shop around the corner. I loved being able to grab a cup of coffee and take a short metro ride to the brooklyn bridge, where I got to enjoy the beautiful manhattan skyline. Also, the transit to Times Square was not bad at all! The A line takes you directly there. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I didn't meet Fola unfortunately as she was away for the weekend. She had prepared the apartment so I could check myself in but due to a misunderstanding in the instructions I got locked out and couldn't get into the apartment. I couldn't reach her by phone because her phone had died. Luckily I wasn't carrying any luggage other than two small backpacks so I just left her text and online messages and left the building as I had to go catch a show. Fola did call me back about an hour later when she got her phone back on. She apologized and explained to me what went wrong. I was returning home pretty late that night but she made sure to be be around by phone contact in case I had any more problems getting in and I didn't. She called to check in on me again the next day to make sure that everything was alright and I really appreciate that. Other than this small kink in the check-in everything else was fine. The apartment was nice and as described. The neighbourhood was also nice and convenient to subway stops and groceries. Since the room is located at the front end of the house I was afraid it would be noisy, but the street it's on was actually a pretty quiet residential street. You can hear some footsteps of people coming in and out the building but it's not bad. Only stayed here for two nights and I was mostly out of the house during the day. I would happily stay here again if I visit NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Gil’s space is everything the reviews say and more. He has thought of every detail, and was extremely accommodating and understanding when I got the check in time wrong, offering to store my luggage until the room was ready! Gil also provides an amazing guidebook, and checked in every day to see if I needed anything. Highly recommend a stay in this beautiful Flatbush home away from home. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Florrie’s place was beautiful and she was an amazing host. You cannot go wrong with this lovely flat.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi gillade verkligen den här söta lägenheten i hjärtat av LES! Det är en etta med sovrum (det finns gott om galgar för att hänga upp kläder i sovrummet) och lyan ser precis ut som på bilderna. Funkar perfekt för ett par eller för den som reser själv (dubbelsäng i sovrummet). Lägenheten är ren och prydlig och består av en skön slappyta och lagom stor kokvrå. Området är livligt utan att vara störande. Här finns barer, caféer, butiker, supermarkets, tvätterior och gym inpå knuten. AC:n och wifin funkar utan problem. Handfatet i badrummet var rangligt och ringklockan och en av lamporna var vid vårt besök trasiga, men det störde inte nämnvärt. Samtliga delar skulle dessutom inom kort fixas. Vi träffade aldrig Joanna, men hon var lätt att ha att göra med och svarade snabbt på våra meddelanden när vi var på plats. När vi anlände blev vi mötta av Maria som visade oss lägenheten och var mycket hjälpsam. Bland annat gjorde hon en extra uppsättning nycklar till oss på nolltid när vi bad om det. Vi skulle absolut bo i lyan nästa gång vi åker till Lower East Side! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We took the subway to our quaint room in Bushwick. I lived in Manhattan for about 12 years, and never really explored Brooklyn. I was very excited about staying in Bushwick, but also thought it's so far from the city. Well I was wrong. The subway was fast and very efficient with connections to other lines. Bushwick itself is awesome. So many sweet restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The room was perfect for us. There was even a closet, which is sometimes rare in NYC. Josh and Jess were great host, thanks for the toaster. ;-)\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had an absolutely fabulous time staying here! I'll be honest, I am very foreign to NYC and had little no knowledge about Bushwick before booking this place, but boy did I luck out—this place was PERFECT! Jess and Josh are so sweet, attentive and have great communication skills—any questions, comments or concerns I expressed were responded to in a flash! They definitely made me feel much more comfortable in traveling to the city alone and helped me get a scope for the area, as well as tips for traveling around the city/what to do! Their apartment was just steps away from a cluster of cute coffee shops, restaurants and an organic bodega, and was maybe a minute or two walk from the subway stations -- super nice! I felt safe walking back to the apartment after going out at night which was excellent. During the day, its fun to walk around the neighborhood and check out the badass graffiti (some of which is sponsored by the Bushwick Collective, so it's legitimate), as well as roam into open art galleries. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My boyfriend and I stayed for a week at Jessica's place. We didn't have any problems checking in, and the host would respond to our questions on time. The location was good, the neighborhood is pretty and very safe. It was close to restaurants, shops and grocery stores and less than a mile away from the forest hills-71 av subway. Just by taking the E train we were in Manhattan in about 25-30 minutes, which wasn't bad at all.  For the price, it was nice to have our own private room with a private bathroom and kitchen. We even had a table with chairs, couch and television with cable. The bed was big and really comfy. The only problem that we had with this listing was cleanliness. It was really dirty. When we first got there the bedroom and bathroom floor were full of hair and it was dusty as well. We got there a little earlier than expected and Rose, the lady that welcomed us, was changing the sheets and finishing cleaning. We dropped off our bags and left expecting to find a clean room when we came back. I let Jessica know about the problem and she never got back to me which wasn't a big deal because I assumed it was going to be taken care of. When we got back the room was a little better but still dirty. The worst thing was the bathroom tub which was clogged with hair. Everything was full of hair!!! \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location was good, nice and safe although there are not a lot of restaurants and places for eating something in the area. We stay only one night for going to the airport the day after. Jessica was kind, she aswered very quickly and asked us if all was ok. But the problem is the house itself... first because it is not nice (it's a basement with a very low roof and noisy plumbing) and above all because it was dirty! We didn't share the house with other people so it means that they didn't clean or did it badly. I couldn't stay there anymore. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Geri was a lovely host and was always accommodating above and beyond what most others would. We arrived quite late into JFK and Geri stayed awake until all hours to let us in and then when our flight got delayed until late evening on the day of our departure she allowed us to store our luggage with her so we could spend the day in Brooklyn. Her communication was always clear and while she was only a msg away and we always felt we had our privacy. The space is comfortable and has everything you would expect in a motel/hotel setup. Her futon is very comfortable and even with a bad back I had no trouble at all. The bathroom is spacious, light and clean with wonderful water pressure. We would happily spend a month living there while exploring the sights of Brooklyn and New York.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was my first time using Airbnb and I thought It was going to be a messy and awkward experience. However I was proven wrong. Niko was a great and reliable host. He responded to my messages fast and was able to help me in any way he could when I was there. I would definitely consider staying at his place again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time staying at this property. We were worried that it was a bit far from Manhattan but it was just over an hour by public transport so not too bad. There is a very nice park next to property which is great for the kids. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Daniels place couldn’t have been better for my stay. The room is large and spacious and the apartment is kept impeccably clean. Daniel has a kind, energetic and friendly disposition. The neighborhood is quiet making it easy to sleep at night. The air conditioning and fan are both fantastic. I don’t have a bad word to say about my stay at this apartment or location. It’s an absolute steal with regards to price. Daniel replied instantly if I ever needed anything.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was spacious and very, very clean. Code needed to enter building and apartment which is super convenient and parking wasn't too bad. Great location, with many restaurants and bodegas/delis open late. Also a short walk to the subway. We loved the apartment. Thanks, Judith! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We booked it last minute, and she still managed to accommodated us. The place is very clean, and well equipped. It's about 30 minutes subway ride to the city which isn't bad at all. I recommend this place, especially if you are traveling with friends who are on a budget!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Simpel og lille bolig, fin til en lav pris. Tæt på metro. God og venlig vært. Mange lejere om et toilet/badeværelse. Der var støj fra de andre gæster om natten og ventetid til wc. Dog fint til yngre mennesker eller par med teenagere. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Descent place but there are better places out there with the same value, it is basically a basement so be prepared for funny odors, noises, etc the room is very small the mattress was really bad (one of them) it caused my back to ache really bad overall good only for a very quick visit</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Departamento acogedor y cómodo que responde a la publicación. Excelente ubicación en Williamsburg , cerca de bares , restaurantes y tiendas. Los sábados a un paso de Smorgasburg    . Ubicado a tres cuadras del subte (Website hidden by Airbnb) La anfitriona siempre conectada y dispuesta a responder a nuestras necesidades.    Nos enamoramos de Williamsburg y vivimos 17 días como en casa. Lo recomiendo</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was really nice. Location to the train was pretty good. The neighborhood wasnt bad. But it wasn’t great either. But the apartment itself made up for it! Definitely would stay again</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a good stay overall, minus a few important issues that will prevent us from staying here again. The bed is incredibly uncomfortable, with one side sunken in so badly that my boyfriend nearly rolled off several times. There was so much dust in the apartment that we woke up every morning with sore throats from allergies. There were dust balls on the floor in every corner of the apartment, as if it had not been properly cleaned in a long time. And the shower has black mold that really needs to be addressed, at least with Kilz. Further, and this is not the host's fault, the water pressure in the shower is awful, and even worse, the shower head blasts boiling hot water every few minutes with zero warning. I had first degree burns on my back the first time it happened, and even taking cold showers the remaining four days of our trip did not prevent the boiling water from blasting us. It was very upsetting, but again, probably not the host's fault. Lastly, there was only one roll of toilet paper in the apartment when we arrived for our five-night stay. One. We walked a couple of blocks and bought more, and then left it at the apartment for the next guest, but that was an annoyance that wasn't necessary with proper planning.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Nice apartment in a very convient location in Manhattan. You cannot go wrong with staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location of the place is great, just 15-20 mins walk to the CBD. It’s located near a hospital, it may get a little noisy at night but wasn’t that bad. The WiFi is pretty slow too. The host replies promptly and accommodated to our needs really well. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Space was great. Very clean and stylish. Pictures match exactly! Brian was very attentive and responsive. He had had warned us about noise as the apt is right on the train line, but the sound wasn’t bad at all! Sounded more like white noise if you had the windows closed. Only complaint was there was no way to block light in the morning from the huge windows... but it probably made us get up and make the most of our trip. There is a full kitchen, but no microwave. Bed was super comfy!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great, clean place with ideal transport links. It’s a bit of a distance into Manhattan but the journey isn’t too bad. Brian was easy to reach and helpful!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place and Brian is very easy to work with. Bathroom is large for NYC; bed is comfortable. Noise from the train is not bad at all - my partner and I had no trouble sleeping.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Heerlijk ruime kamer in een prachtig huis, gelegen in een rustige straat in Brooklyn. Hoewel de gedeelde badkamer naast onze kamer lag, hoorden we hier geen douche- en wc geluiden van andere gasten!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bill is nice, cats are cute, bed is comfortable, location is not bad. You can enjoy quite fresh Brooklyn' morning, proespect park is also a bones if you like running</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tijdens onze verlate vlucht hadden we al contact met Bill. Hij kwam met diverse suggesties om bij zijn huis te geraken vanaf het vliegveld. Bij aankomst was hij nog wakker om ons een sleutel te geven. Hij kwam wat chaotisch over, maar was erg vriendelijk. Er hangt een nare geur in huis. We vonden de keuken en badkamer vies. Gelukkig hadden we slippers meegenomen. De slaapkamer was oke. Het bed sliep prima. We zijn alleen in huis geweest om te slapen en douchen. Verder waren we veel op stap.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Oates + Bill are wonderful. I worked in the city every day and found the subway EXTREMELY easy to use and navigate. I would leave during the typical commute hour in the morning and return between 6pm-8pm to avoid a crowded ride back, and found that very helpful. I typically stay in Manhattan and know the lower part of Manhattan well so was nervous with this being my first time staying in BK, and not knowing the area at all, but it was a breeze. They’re are great little coffee places and restaurants close to the house and on the way of the very short walk to the subway station to grab a coffee for your commute or (if you’re pregnant like me) your first breakfast of the morning. The first stop in Manhattan in about a 10 minute subway ride so not bad at all. As far as the home goes. I felt safe, well looked after, and had no problems sharing a bathroom which was my concern. It ended up being no problem at all. All guests and residents of the home have an unspoken respect for each other and their space and needs. I honestly felt like I lived here and Bill + Oates were my longtime roommates. Would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi har været yderst tilfredse med at bo hos det søde og meget hjælpsomme par Nick og Grace, der var meget nemme at omgås. Værelset var fint og en helt ny seng var dejlig at krybe i efter en lang dag i byen. Metroen er meget tæt på, så vi kunne komme til downtown på en halv time. Nabolaget var noget anderledes end vi er vant til, men vi følte os aldrig utrygge, ej heller om aftenen. Tværtimod var folk meget hjælpsomme på stationen, i kaffebaren og hos den lokale købmand. Det gik fint med at dele badeværelse med værtsparret. Den lille hund var så sød, at vi næsten puttede den i kufferten, da vi skulle videre </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Grace and Nick were fabulous hosts. My boyfriend and I drove in for the night to see a show and Grace warmly greeted us and answered any questions we had about the area. Their apartment was extremely cozy and nicely furnished. The room we stayed in was very private and quiet. There was ample parking along the street and the subway line was right around the corner. We adored little Mikan and enjoyed the rooftop views as well. Too bad we didn't have more time...we would love to come back!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay was comfortable and convenient. The only downside is the room has bad sound isolation from neighboring apartments and the bathroom. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Didier's place is perfectly located in Park Slope, near Prospect Park, the subway lines, MANY great restaurants, and on a safe, QUIET street.  The queen size bed is wonderfully comfortable, as is the sofa.  Cable TV was a great plus for late nights.  Coffee was stocked, all appliances are spanking clean, and the shower is beautiful.  I've stayed at many airbnb places and this one ranks very high.  Didier checked on us several times and was readily available for questions, suggestions, and great conversation.  You can't go wrong with Didier's place, and it is a super value.  Most highly recommend Didier and his lovely place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Apt looked pretty much like the pics on page. Nothing modern, but it served the purpose we were looking for which was a clean, safe & cheap place to stay for an event. There's no a/c unit in apt, just heating which was okay because we went during winter but im sure it could be a problem during summer. There was also a really small amount of hot water when all of us tried showering which wasbt too bad, just caught us off guard. Its conveniently located about a block from the train which takes you to Atlantic Ave and from there you can be in the city in about 20 mins which isnt bad at all. Host was friendly and very helpful when we locked ourselves out of the apt one night. Lol\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was good and Hazel was really sweet. The area however seemed a bit scary and i had a bad experience in a shop nearby . </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a good stay at fundas house. We doesn't meet her in person. It seems like whole is rented to Airbnb guests. The trashcab in the kitchen and in the bathroom (where you have to put in the used toilet paper!) was not made empty in the 3 days of our stay. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The sofas in the room was not clean (one was on really bad chape) </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This airbnb would have received 5 stars if it weren't for two huge issues. First, the wood around the lock on our door was chipping away badly. The screws to the lock itself were coming out and I had to push the screws in every time I wanted to close the door. Secondly, there were rusty nails sticking out of the floor by the foot of the bed. This is a terrible potential health problem.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is close to the subway. Overall not bad!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed at Matt's for almost ten days. And by the end of it, it felt like home! It's a quiet neighborhood in Williamsburg. Not a bad walk to the subway (Matt was kind enough to give us his card) and fairly close to the cafes. The apartment was comfortable for three - two on the bed upstairs and one teenager on the couch. The terrace is so beautiful, we had our morning coffee and evening whiskey there all the days! The kitchen was equipped, as was the bathroom, the wifi was super (only Matt's response to messages was faster). We had packages delivered to us and found it conveniently in the lobby. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Vi hadde et flott ukesopphold på Urban Jungle Garden.  Det var rent og ryddig i leiligheten.  To bad + et ekstra toalett var veldig greit når vi var 5 damer (3 voksne og 2 tenåringer) som skulle opp og ut på samme tid.  Alt vi trengte fant vi i leiligheten. Kjempekoselig hage, som vi ikke fikk brukt særlig mye, men det var mest været skyld. Stuen brukte vi ikke, hadde kjøkkenet som \"\"base\"\" (ekstra dobbeltseng i stua)  Vi hadde også god dialog med verten.  Fikk en ekstra mail et par dager før vi dro med masse god informasjon.  Kodelås på inngangsdøra gjorde at vi ikke trengte å styre med å hente nøkkeI og slapp å tenke på det hvis noen ville tilbake før andre osv. I tillegg ble spørsmål vi hadde raskt besvart (både før og under oppholdet). Det var kort vei til t-banen og supermarked.  T-banen tok ca. 1/2 time inn til Manhatten.  Vi kjøpte ukeskort og det sparte vi raskt inn..    Veldig fornøyde med oppholdet. :)\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Really enjoyed staying here with my friends. We’re a group of college students and the place was quirky and spacious. Location isn’t bad considering it’s price. Lots of kitchen utensils were available which was great. Eric was super understanding when we got our checkout time confused and was very willing to work with our schedule. Thanks again, Eric!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Veronica and her husband are a perfect airbnb host! They offer private rooms and a large shared living room to their guests. The room has enough storage and comfortable bad. The bathroom is only shared with the guests, you don't need to wait for the others and Veronica maintains it properly. The living room is well equipped and it has a hostel-like atmosphere. We had a great time there, and we will recommend her apartment to our friends visiting New York. Marta & Peter</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Veronica was a lovely host! the house was clean and we had everything what we needed:) she baked us nice cornbread in the morning which we really enjoyed! there was coffee, tea, milk and cerials! Sometimes at night you were able to here people outside in Brooklyn, but it was not too bad. we had our own little room with a TV, closet and mirror. we shared the bathroom and the living room  with two other rooms, but they were all nice! I would highly recommend Victoria's house and If I need to stay in nyc again I'm going to ask Veronica again :) thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Zowel Veronica als haar man Charlie ontvangen je erg gastvrij. Je deelt een woonkamer en badkamer met twee andere kamers, dus het kan enigszins druk worden bij de badkamer. Het eerder neerzetten en later ophalen van bagage is heel relaxt. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was great! Veronica was flexible about checkin times and very friendly. Our room was basic but clean and comfortable. The location is not bad - the main advantage is that it is very close to the subway.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Erwähnenswert ist, dass bei Veronica mehrere airbnb'ler in einer angefügten unteren Etage  in verschiedenen Zimmern unterkommen können. Es gibt dort ein Gemeinschaftsbad und einen Aufenthaltsraum mit wasserkocher und bereitgestellten Tee.  Das ist uns sehr positiv aufgefallen! Auch dass sie uns Handtücher bereitgestellt hat,  fanden wir ganz toll! Die Heizung im Zimmer, die man selbst einstellen konnte, war leider etwas laut, aber das scheint in den USA so üblich zu sein. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location is ok, but smell was very bad... with a children it not safe , because of mold smell</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location was awesome!  Quiet street in a bustling neighborhood. Walking distance to many must-see locations. The subway is conveniently around the corner. The apartment is small, but not bad for Manhattan. Communication with David was quick and easy.  The only area for improvement was the cleanliness of the apartment when we checked in, but it wasn't horrible. Also, there were plenty of cleaning products on hand to tidy up. Overall a great value.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You can expect exactly what you pay for with this apartment - it’s small, but comfortable for two, and has everything you need for a sightseeing trip to NYC! The fact that it’s on the fourth floor means that you have a LOT of stairs to climb, which is challenging with suitcases, but again this is advertised as such so shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s done their research. The bed is a Tempur mattress which is very very very soft - not our cup of tea, but there’s nothing wrong with it. We were greeted by Chris the cleaner, who was very apologetic about still being there and was very friendly. He did a great job and, while the apartment looked a little tired, it was overall quite clean.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great place in a great location with a great host. You can't go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>We were here visiting family. It was a great location, as It was just steps away from our family. The neighborhood is great and easily walkable from our location. Communication was good and it was in general a nice place for the price. However, I have to say I the bed was very hard and uncomfortable for both me and my husband. No extra pillows made it worse. Unfortunately, I don't think we'd stay here next time we're visiting family.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The appartment has a good location, It is small but comfortable. We had everything we needed to have a good stay. Whitney allways answered quickly and she is very nice. Beatrice (the cat) is so sweet and fluffy, she does not disturb, she is quiet and loving.  The only negative thing is that as it is a very small apparment its  smelly because of the cat, we tried to ventilate because when we arrived we felt a strong bad odor. Then we got accustomed but it was hard the first days... We thing its necessary to clean a bit better, specially under the bed and the floor.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>As the other reviews say, Mark is a very warm and welcoming host.  He greeted us when we arrived and carried our bags too. Unfortunately the flat is up five flights of stairs with no lift so it was hard to come and go as I had a heavy case.  The flat is nice enough but we paid a cleaning fee and the kitchen wasn't clean. The privacy element of the flat was not really clear in the review, but you are sharing and don't have so much of your own space as Mark has to come through your room to come and go. Aside from these factors the location of the apartment is great near the Guggenheim and Central Park. The cost point of the place is not too bad considering the cost of hotels in New York but it's worth comparing before booking  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mark has that genuine NYC warmth that is actually a thing. New Yorkers get a bad rap for being rude and unfriendly. So not true! Mark is a shining example of down to Earth warm and friendly! And, his place was a real value, in a fantastic neighborhood in Manhattan. This place has a rustic, genuine New York City charm as well.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A nice place in a good location. Spent most of time outside of the place so it wasn’t bad. Trustworthy host.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>\"So myself and the family (15 others) headed to NY for my sister's 40th birthday celebration. I'll first start off with the good. The location was in Brooklyn about 6 blocks from the subway which was great. The neighborhood was very diverse with all types of people varying in age, race, gender, etc. The delis, grocery store, liquor store, and restaurants were all in walking distance. So the location is best thing about the unit. With the exception of some vulgar language being yelled at night no issues. Now I have to get the the challenges we encountered. Two of us (my wife and myself) arrived ahead of everyone else by about 5 hours. When we arrived it was more than 90 degrees in the unit with no air previously turned on. So I notice AC units in (almost) every room (one room only had fans) of the four stories so I activate them. The description had no mention of AC units but it also didn't mention central air. Being from the south central air is normal for us and it's what we expect, however no big deal as the AC units were activated. With such a large place we figured it would take a while to cool off so we leave. As a precaution I call to speak with Nina (who I never once spoke to) and I get Ziv someone who works closely with her and ask him to send someone to check the AC. We leave and go to Manhattan only to come back to an even hotter unit. So the person hasn't made it to the unit yet so I take matters into my hands and investigate. Turns out the exhaust was laying on the floor and pumping hot air back into the 7 rooms. So I locate scattered window mounts and hook up two units. Finally after 4 hours Ronny gets there (very nice and knowledgeable guy) and pulls out all these window stoppers and tape, so after giving him a hand with most of the units we are on our way to cooling down. By the time the rest of the party arrived which included: moms, dads, cousins, aunts, uncles. They were not pleased with being hot, not one bit, not knowing how much worse it was before. So finally moving on we discover our party of 16 doesn't have enough supplied towels or toilet tissue to last us the three days we will be staying. So again I call and get Ziv and he drops what I call a \"\"bomb\"\" and says</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place is in a great location, especially for families. Prospect Park is close by and has a great playground. On 5th Avenue there are loads of funky restaurants and cool shops. It's a great base to discover Brooklyn. The apartment is in a charming brownstone. Downside is that you do hear the hosts upstairs walking. Nothing too bad, just a note. At night though, it's super quiet so great for a good night's sleep for us and our toddler. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>From the beginning, commmunication with Christophe was smooth and easy. He responded promptly and helped out with tips on how to best get to his place from Newark (yes, I had booked the wrong airport) to helping out with setting up an iron at the apartment, random request but we were in town for a wedding so it was greatly appreciated. The place is in a perfect location in a great neighborhood with lots of options for cafes, bars, shops and very close to the subway station. The pictures show a beautiful and clean apartment, but it is much better in person. Very clean, cozy, and with a great book selection! I know you don’t go to NY to stay indoors and read, but it was nice to browse through their books on those down hours or with a morning coffee.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Brandon was so helpful and friendly! The location was absolutely perfect for our needs and we were thrilled with the garden area. We were able to get a few suggestions for restaurants and coffee shops in the area, and Brandon never pointed us wrong once. He was detailed and welcoming, and the space was exactly what we were expecting. All in all, highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jag kan varmt rekommendera den här lägenheten till andra resenärer. Isaac och Christina är erfarna och professionella värdar, och gav tydlig och bra information om allt vi efterfrågade. Deras beskrivning av lägenheten och omgivningen stämmer väl, och detta är ett utmärkt boende för att utforska NYC, med närhet till tunnelbanan och välrenommerade restauranger, barer och de bästa shoppingkvarteren i staden inom gångavstånd. Trots detta är själva boendet beläget på en lugn gata, och vi hade inga problem med oljud eller trafik på nätterna. Vi inte heller något problem med värmen i lägenheten även om detta var mitt i sommaren och luftkonditioneringen i alla tre rummen fungerade utmärkt. Kökspentryt är litet, men var genomtänkt och välutrustat och innehåller allt man behöver. Det fungerade smidigt med två (om än små) badrum. Internet fungerade perfekt, och det fanns generöst med vägguttag. Det fanns tillräckligt med garderobsutrymme och plats att hänga upp kläder och ställa undan väskor, och generöst med tillgång till extra lakan, kuddar, täcken och handdukar. Vi bodde fyra vuxna väninnor där i en vecka, varav två personer delade dubbelsängen i det större sovrummen, en person sov i det andra sovrummet i den stora enkelsängen (eller lilla dubbelsängen) och en person sov på soffan. Detta fungerade väldigt bra, men jag tror inte att man kan bo bekvämt med fler vuxna personer än så någon längre tid om man inte reser som par eller med barn (eller kanske bara är betydligt yngre än oss!).    </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room was as described but really too small for two people. Tameisha was nice to wait for us arriving quite late in the evening but we would not recommend this room if you are in two.we slept very bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Unfortunately, my stay at this studio was not enjoyable. Tameisha was not very welcoming, however, her mother was very nice. I don't consider myself to be a complainer but I feel it prudent to inform the public about this particular residence. First, it would have been very appropriate for the hosts to have mentioned that there were two children under three living in the home. The studio I stayed in was located on the first floor. The toddlers, like clockwork, began running, stomping and jumping each morning at 10:30am and would not stop until 11:00pm each night. One morning they came downstairs in my area and were banging outside of my door with no adult supervision.  After calling for someone, to come and get the children  for at least ten minutes, a young man, who looked like he had just woke up, came downstairs, gave me a very unapologetic apology, and closed the door leading to the upstairs area. Second, there was a private entrance leading to the studio where I was staying. A strange man came downstairs from the family area, one morning, and exited out of the studio entrance rather than the family entrance upstairs. I knew this because he slammed the door on the way out. All I could think about was I am a single woman in New York anything could have happened to me. this was a serious matter of safety. Lastly, the linens on the bed did not look fresh nor inviting. Ultimately, I couldn't take anymore and went to a hotel. The biggest draw back to using the Airbnb service is that you have to pay for your entire stay, all at once, and cannot get a refund for bad service. I know that there are a lot of listings on the site, but it would be a really good idea to hire persons, in each region, whose job it would be to inspect the different facilities to ensure that what the host has listed is accurate. As I stated earlier, I am not a complainer, however, this experience has compelled me to not only inform potential residents of the deceptive advertising, claiming that this is a great place to stay, but also to rate your establishment a \"\"0\"\" on a scale of 1 to 5 with \"\"5\"\" being the best. In closing</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We arrived very late the day, but Kishoria waited for us and gave the directions how to get there. She was very nice, very considerate, and prepared everything. But the position does have some distance to the JFK, which is 20 bucks by taxi, and 8 bucks by black car. Also, the room does not have a window, and gets a little cold even with the heater on. There is another thing to mention. Kishoria left the day we tried to catch the plane, she told us her daughter would call the taxi for us. But the young lady did not until we knocked on her door. Then the taxi driver drove into the wrong way which eventually caused us missed the flight! My suggestion is to call a taxi on your own!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Amazing host! I booked the wrong date but host was able to accommodate me for the day I needed. The host made my stay very comfortable, the basement studio was very clean and tidy. Everything one needed was available. Location is great! It is very close to the Long Island light rail that goes to Penn Station. This will definitely be my spot to stay every time I come to NY.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was very clean and comfy. It is really close to the airport, you can either take public transportation or take a taxi which is not that expensive. The fact that is close to public transportation makes it easier to get to Manhattan. It took me around 45 minutes to an hour to get here, and that's not bad. We had an awesome time, Kishorie is a very nice person and The communication was excellent. She offered to help us and give us any information we need. Thanks for everything! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Place exactly as described. Definitely not for tall people, though. But it was warm and cozy and had everything we needed for a one-night stay. Tea, coffee, and some fruit was provided which were great for the morning. It’s about 1.5 miles from the nearest station but the walk really isn’t that bad. Food and other services are nearby. Great place to stay overall.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Kishorie’s home was extremely clean when I first got there. As I stayed there I began to see small things I felt wrong with the apartment that I disregarded (Example: Shower Door handle fell off upon touch) I excused it as something that the home had always dealt with and placed it on the floor of the bathroom. I also noticed the closet door was open, however also excused this, because the closet had nothing inside for me. My visit in New York was for an event that I was to be apart of. Upon coming back a friend of mine accompanied me to the apartment, and stayed for 3 hours before leaving. After I left Kishorie called me, rather impolitely, and accused me of breaking her shower door. As well as accused me of breaking her closet door( a closet that I had no reason to enter, I stayed in the home for one night). She also complained about my friend who came to the home for the 3 hour period and accused me of slamming doors during the day, when I hadnt checked in until 8pm, and then left to go to my event. The apartment was great, the host not so much. Would not reccomend solely based on host interaction.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The other reviews aren't wrong - wonderful hosts that make your stay in NYC feel truly special. The neighbourhood can't be beat either!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had such a wonderful time here! It was easy to keep in contact and schedule when we would arrive. The room looks exactly like the picture but was better. There were three lovely women who were very friendly with three lovable dogs. All the details were so great! It was to bad we could not stay longer. I would stay again in a heart beat. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Beware of this listing. Very disappointing Airbnb experience. My boyfriend and I decided to stay at this apartment for 2 nights, after we saw the positive reviews and pictures. In reality, the level of cleanliness wasn't as the pictures make it seem. We arrived at the apartment around 1:00pm. Judith had assured me that the space would be ready when we would get there. We were shocked at the state of the apartment. The entryway was partially blocked with what looked like a bedframe and slabs of wood leaned up against the banister. We were shown our room just off the entryway and immediately noticed dust/hair on the floor. The bed sheets were peppered with dryer link and human hair. One of the two towels was ragged with makeup smears. We decided to let it go, and not make the situation uncomfortable. I went to the bathroom, which is when I reached my tipping point. A layer of dust lined every surface and the shower contained hairs of previous guests. Mold on the shower curtain and toothpaste splatter on the faucet and mirror. One of the main selling points of this apartment was the assurance of a private bathroom; however, when we saw the state of the facilities, we were grossed out and uncomfortable. Outside the bathroom, the kitchen and living room were messy,unwelcoming and cluttered. At this point, I felt frustrated and swindled, since the pictures on the listing reflect a tidy and comfortable space. My boyfriend and I discussed in the bedroom and decided that the situation was so bad that we had to say something. Airbnb recommends first addressing any issues with the host so I tried to politely talk with Judith. I let her know about the sheets and the dirty bathroom (I didn't mention anything about the bedroom floor, kitchen, living room). She interrupted me and said she would change the sheets and clean the bathroom, seemingly taking my comment personally. I thanked her for looking after it, and my boyfriend and I left for the afternoon. When we came back, the sheets had been changed and the bathroom was adequately clean, which I appreciated and let her know. Later that night, we arrived back around 11:30pm, said hello, and went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. Judith and her roommate were watching a movie. Around 12:00am, I went to the living room and said “Goodnight” to them, assuming that since we were going to bed, they would turn down the volume. By 12:30, I couldn’t sleep from the noise. I got out of bed to tell them that I could hear everything and that I would appreciate if they could keep it down. To have to tell them this seemed quite ridiculous to be honest.They apologized but never turned down the (Website hidden by Airbnb) this point, I tried (unsuccessfully) to sleep through the noise to not sound annoying.I would not recommend this listing, there are much cleaner, comfortable apartments at this price point in...</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Location is amazing! Few minutes walk to Fulton station, World Trade Center, and Wall Street. Loved how ultra comfortable the bed was. Andy is especially helpful, and even left a couple of Century 21 gift cards for me. The bedroom was organized, although the rest of the apartment could have been tidier. Overall you can't go wrong with this place for value and location. Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Meget dejlig lejlighed, med to gode soveværelser og fine senge. Stedets bedste feature er den lille have med veranda. Køkken og bad fungerer fint og der er, hvad der skal være. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>She seems thoroughgoing host. Taking shower isn't bad, but hot bolier pillar behind the door must be covered with some safety equipment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is a cute and atypic flat. Around the street it's not dangerous and it's calm. You've got metro station at 4 minutes by walk and a foodshop at 5 min by walk. The Ava's roomates are very nice and helpfully. Just one bad point, it's not totally clean in the bathroom. But we are very happy about our holidays in this flat. Thanks a lot Ava !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Read the fine print carefully, it is not a private room , also the bed is not comfortable so bringing your linens would help. I’m really not a complainer but the room and washroom were filthy with mould in the washroom and a bad smell</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was a wonderful stay and although the circumstances were bad, Erin made the stay a delight and was super easy to communicate with - definitley coming back!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gita was a great host ! Even if we didn't actually meet (too bad !), she was very helpful and friendly before, during and after our stay ! \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I really loved staying here! Gita sent really detailed instructions that made checking into her apartment super easy. The apartment was lovely and cozy. I really felt at home. The neighborhood has so many awesome restaurants, coffee shops, and bars that are within walking distance. You could really just stay in this area and explore lots of the jewels the neighborhood has to offer. Moreover the subway line is just 3 blocks away which makes going to other parts of the city really easy. I have no bad things to say about this place or Gita! It was really fantastic and I would definitely be willing to stay here again. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I really enjoyed my stay in Astoria. I had a good time in the area and Petya was very great host.  There are a lot of really good food options in the area and you can't go wrong. It's very close to a Metro stop maybe 2-3 minutes. Loved it! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Marjorie was a very discreet host, so she only gave us the most important information. The room and the bathroom were very clean and cozy. There was a coffee machine and milk in the fridge, thanks for that! First we did not felt that safe in the neighborhood, but that was only the first feeling, because it looks like a ghetto and you are one of the only white people arround. We did not experience something bad there. There was no problem on our way from the subway to home at 10 p.m. In the night you maybe should take a cab back there. Marjories husband was very helpful, becaus we could use his phone when our shuttle to the airport did not show up. So an advice: do NOT take a SuperShuttle, you pay in advance and they do not show up...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hele fijne locatie, Marjorie en Paul hebben aan alles gedacht. De kamer is ruim met een mooie badkamer en heel schoon. Hoewel deze locatie niet heel dicht bij grote bezienswaardigheden ligt, is er wel een metrostation vlakbij waarmee alles goed te bereiken is.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I've been staying at airbnb places for the last two months until my apartment is ready and have had my highs and lows. This place was definitely one of the highs! The place is adorable! And so clean and organized. The hosts -- George and Diane - were incredibly responsive and attentive. I can't say one bad thing about it. Astoria is great. The place is 2-1/2 blocks from the N/Q train (Broadway stop) and a quick ride into the city. I would definitely stay here again. A great place to stay if you want to visit NYC and get out of the hustle at the end of the day.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wa had a nice time in NYC. The appartement was very clean and handy. Caroline was convenient as we arrived late. The only detail is the quality that is bad in the room (better in the living room)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We spent 4 nights at the apartment. With 2 little kids (9 months and 2 years). We discocered Harlem is not bad place at all and it was always an adventure to be outside. The entrance is easy once you learn the trick with the lock and we felt realy safe. The apartment was very well equipt and we were glad to see some good coffee and other canned products were left by previous guests or host. Everything was clean and vacuum cleaner left for host use in case needed. The pack'n'play looked brand new and kids linen were never used.  We had to do small modification to the coffee table in the living room and put it a side since the kids thought it would be a nice game to flip it. The host was generously let us make a very late checkout and this was realy great save. The bathroom was clean and many quality shampoos and soaps left for guest use. No doubt i would preferred this appartment over hotel.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We booked way in advance and every time we had a question, Julia answered very quickly. When we arrived there was a sweet welcome for us. The place is awesome! It's very spacious, has 2 big bedrooms and a badroom with a good shower. There are a lot of utensils if you want to cook yourself. The internet is very good, we could even stream a soccer match. Julia asked several times how we have been and gave us handy advice about some services in the neighbourhood. It's located between the red lines 2 and 3 and the three green lines (express) so you can be at Union Square within 15 min. We had a great time and we definitely would recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ruim appartement op een fijne locatie. Hygiene kan veel beter, badkamer mag een make over. Inrichting is leuk maar door de hygiene net niet echt af.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The flat is clean and spacious... but the area is not recomendet... sadly we had to expirence that a guy did salivate to my wife while holding our 6 year old girl at her hand, after she did give him money as asked for. Sorry but as lovely and clean the flat is, is not a area for white persones... white people are exposed to rasismus in this area... sadly we left New York with bad feelings and are happy being home.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Andrew and his place were wonderful. He was super helpful with both local recommendations and check in/out processes. I would definitely stay at his place again. The rooftop view was spectacular and the perfect way to wind down after a busy day of sightseeing. You can't go wrong with this place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tony is a great host! I really appreciate that he responded quickly to my messages - I was in a bad bond because my original Airbnb reservation cancelled on me very last moment (the day before my trip).\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mysig lägenhet med bra läge nära tunnelbanan. Rent badrum, bra wi-fi och vänlig värd, allt enligt annonssidan. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room share a bathroom with two other rooms. 7 people trying to shower at the same time can make for a difficult morning.  The building construction noise from across the street was a bad way to wake up. I would stay somewhere else. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall it was a pretty good stay at Veronica's place. It was raining the whole day, so we ended up not really going anywhere. She also gave us an umbrella, though we did not really use it in the end because it was only one while there were three of us. The room was not really as spacious and fancy as we thought, but it was not bad as it has what we need. Be aware that there was no kitchen sink to do the dish, so we gotta use the bathroom which was not so convenient.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The place was exactly what me and my friends were looking for: a safe clean affordable place to travel to manhattan. While I enjoyed the room and common space, what really made it for me were Veronica’s quick responses and eagerness to help. I originally told her that I was going to arrive at 6pm but due to a schedule change I told her last minute that it would be 4pm (wrong of me but very appreciative of how she accommodated for us).\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Amazing place and location at a great price. Was a little bit scared of the neighborhood because I had some previous bad experiences in Brooklyn, but the whole area is so quiet and nice, even at night. It s in an area where you can feel safe walking alone at night, there are some 24/7 stores 2 min away from the apartment and the G line is 3 min away. Veronica was so nice and friendly, she was always so fast in answering all our questions and messages. The whole apartment is really clean and nice, there are 3 different rooms in the apartment, wifi works perfect, you have everything you need (coffee, towels, fridge in the living room, etc). The location is around a 30 min subway ride from Manhattan ( G line - you can easily transfer lines and get basically anywhere in NY really fast). Would definitely recommend this to everyone who s coming to NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fin lejlighed i Brooklyn. Stor og med det der er brug for af køkkenting, hvis man vil lave noget selv. Der er ca 10 min til subway. SUNSET Park ligge lige ved siden af hvor der også er friluftsbad. Nem kontakt med Katie.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is in the best location: close to the subway lines, cafes, Lexington and grocery store. The locale seems safe even when i returned late. The apt itself is clean, new and quiet: just the thing after a busy day/night in NYC. It is well-equipped with all the mod cons and hauntingly fast wifi. Thanks Ange. Yes there are 3 flights of stairs but her, if i can manage 2 pieces of luggage: so can you. The host is caring and responsive: even though she was not in the same city, she was fast to respond to strange questions from me (how to operate tv, where is the kettle). As i was jet lagged, i pinged Ange as 1215am once and she responded within  5 mins. My bad! I even got a late check out so that i can go to the airport later. Thank you Ange for a very lovely experience. I will never stay in a hotel ever again and will definitely look up Ange for my next trip!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Unfortunately I'm having to write my first negative review. I feel bad because I don't think it's entirely Angela's fault. My main issue was how she handled an unexpected issue. We arrived a day late because of a storm that led to our flight being cancelled. When we arrived we realized that although she had given instructions on how to access the key, she had never given us the apartment number. I called once with no response and thankfully she answered on the second call. So we made it into the apartment to all the windows wide open (immediately following a snow storm), it smelt a bit funny but we didn't think much of it. There was a note over the oven saying not to touch it because it she didn't want  it to \"\"start heating again\"\". She had told us the oven was broken but it was a little concerning to think that it might just start heating out of nowhere. The apartment was freezing so we closed all the windows and left for a show. When we returned the apartment smelt of strong fumes. It smelt like a burnt plastic but it was so strong I could barely breathe when we initially walked in. Being exhausted from our show we opened the windows and fell asleep. We woke up still smelling the fumes. I contacted Angela in hopes she would help out</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Cozy and bright room, very clean bathroom, thanks for it. The bad was not enough large for our height (we are tall both), but this small cross was removed by perfect mattress))\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was perfect for a weekend in brooklyn. It was clean upon arrival and was exactly as pictured. Manuela was a great host and was quick to respond to any questions we had during our stay. The hot water pipe was noticeable but not nearly as bad as past reviews make it out to be. Manuela has a great apartment and i would recommend it to anyone looking to spend a weekend in brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Judith's brownstone is a true gem in a fantastic location. Close to restaurants, subway and the park, you can't go wrong here. Although she was out of town, our communications were efficient as she made an effort to be available for questions, concerns and recommendations.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Aangename kamer, goed bed, schone voorzieningen ( Keuken, badkamer ) alleen wat lawaaierig van het verkeer. Goede voorzieningen in de buurt zoals metro, bakker, lunchroom, winkel, restaurant, bar enz. Zeker aan te raden.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The experience me and my friend had at Danielle's apartment was...quite different and disappointing now that we back in the UK I'd say. There were good things about it but also really bad - let me start with the good ones.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Victors and his apartment are great! Victor is a very helpful host. I was sick the first few days and victor gave helped me out with tea and a humidifier. Restaurant, Laundry, supermarkets, and transportation are steps from the apartment. The neighborhood is awesome. The room itself is very cozy. Place is very clean. I can honestly say there is nothing bad about this bnb. Would deff recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My boyfriend and I had a great stay with Victor! Our flight arrived fairly late, and once we arrived we were able to obtain our keys easily. The bed was super comfy, and the towels were large and soft. We weren't around that much, basically just to sleep, and Victor gave us our privacy. The neighborhood is lovely. Just around the corner is a lively street with markets and restaurants. Close to Kingsbridge station, and not too bad of a train ride to Manhattan.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jim is a terrific host and his apartment is as perfect as can be for what it is.  The latter is not a back-handed compliment.  The apartment is a true one-bedroom, NY small but plenty of room for two couples (bed in bedroom and sofa bed in living), in perfect shape, updated kitchen and bathroom, and terrific location between Chelsea and Times Square less than a 5 minute walk to the Highline.  Jim stocks the fridge with soda, water, and even a few beers; plenty of clean towels; shower supplies; extra pillows and blankets.  I have used AirBNB in NYC several times, have never had a bad experience, but even by these standards Jim's place is excellent.  I cannot leave out the price - Jim's place is as reasonable as it gets at about 1/2 the cost of a mid-level hotel room.  And Jim is not just a nice guy, he is totally responsive (not that I needed anything) and accommodating.  I highly recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Comfortable calm space with plenty of room. It was really quiet which was lovely in Manhattan. It’s up 4 flights of stairs with no elevator but that’s not so bad. James is very kind and really easy to communicate with. I’d love to stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay at Oliver's apartment.  He was very helpful and welcoming to us in our week long stay. The location is safe and very close to nearby subway stations.  You truly get to experience living in Brooklyn! There are good restaurants close by, as well as laundromats if you want to carry light and wash clothes during your visit.  Nothing bad trying to be a local! Overall it was an excellent experience and we would definitely recommend his place to you.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stayed in Walther's place from Oct 2-4, 2015, at the peak of hurricane Joaquin! I have nothing bad to say about this apartment. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Mona's apartment was exactly as it appears in the photos. It was small but well equipped and clean. There's everything you might need for a short stay. My wife and I were there for 6 nights and found we were perfectly well catered for. The location is very handy with a good store and places to eat very close by. Getting to Manhattan was very easy so the apartment is well located for trips into the city. Mona herself is lovely, very quick to respond and attentive. You can't go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"I think Ehund is nice so it pains me to give a negative review as I've never left a bad review on an Airbnb before. The problem was cleanliness. The bed I had to sleep in for 7 days upon arrival was full of LOTS of long stringy black hair. I mean a lot. The bed was dirty and very gross along with the floor in there. The bathroom upon arrival had hair all in it too and a dirty white wet towel on the ground folded in two also covered in hair. Someone had swept and left a pile of dirt and hair right in the hallway.  Ehund responded quickly and said he filed a complaint with the cleaning company and I understood it wasnt his fault but that didn't change the fact I had to stay there that whole time since the cancel guidelines are \"\"strict\"\". I wouldn't have left a bad review had I been offered even a refund of the cleaning fee at least but nothing happened.  I stayed in a gross mess for all 7 days. Very disappointed. I slept on the couch most nights because I was very grossed out. Nearly ruined my entire trip but had to try and stay positive for my 11 yr old son since it was his first vacation. Not happy. :(\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Although in Manhattan, not close to Times Square or Subway.  We were able to walk, but sister is a marathon runner and I am still fit enough.  We did not feel threatened at all.  There are some great restaurants nearby, Fluffy’s and Medi.  Columbus Circle is a nice shopping area and closest Subway.  Check in was just, bad.  Place is pricey and traveling companions wished I had just booked a motel room.  As for me, I did really appreciate having separate rooms and we were there only to sleep.  The building and surroundings quiet for the city .  A sound machine helped.  I would not stay again, however.  My sister says she will never stay at an Air B and B again.  The entrance smelled of urine and the apartment was a dump by her standards.  For the money, a hotel room would be much better.  All in all, very disappointing!</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Karens's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. It is so close to Central Park and the metro so we had access to all of NYC outside our door! Her place was exactly as described and had everything we needed. Although you can hear the street noise, I was expecting it to be much worse than it was. It didn't bother us one bit and I didn't have to use ear plugs. I am originally from Chicago, so maybe I was better prepared for it than most. A really great time and I would love to come back soon.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice but outdated apartment in a great and authentic neighborhood. Overall we felt comfortable in Vinneth place. This Apartment has got everything you need, except good wifi or comfortable beds. The beds are the main issue. They are so loud, every movement is accompanied by loud squeeky noises. The Wifi works rather bad and does not cover the whole place. The apartment is a Little outdated, the bathroom has seen better times and the air conditioning is very old and loud. Usually it is not an issue but this place is especially designed to host Airbnb guests, no one regularly life’s here, like it used to be with Airbnb. Therefore you can expect the apartment to be in better shape, especially for the price you pay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Convenient to coffee shops and bars locally. Not bad for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My girlfriend I stayed 3 nights in june 2016. We had a very pleasant stay. Orhun quickly responded to our messages. He also took the time to give us suggestions of places to visit, good restaurants and coffee shops in the neighbourhood. The place is clean and quiet (for new york). There is no elevator, but it's not that bad after the first times. We really enjoyed our stay and we recommend it ! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place was in a great location! The walk up really wasn't that bad, and the apartment had incredible views that more than made up for it! Orhun was incredibly helpful, attentive, and responsive. Would definitely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>First, the communication was good. Orhun responded and gave me details and answered all my questions and more. His place was very clean and we had everything we needed. I was there with my brother. The shower was clean and that's important to me. The apartment is big and nice and clean, basically, nothing bad to say about the place and only good. The location is just amazing and you have everything you need and you're in the center of Manhattan. I like walking so I walked about an hour to each direction. I am recommending Orhun place and will be back again</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything was good before we check in. Great communications and Liana helped my parents carry their luggages up the stairs because I couldn't be there when checking in. But our experience get shittier when a lot of ants climbed into the apartment during the first night of our stay. I contacted Liana the next morning. She didn't get back to me for 24 hours. She said she had bad receptions because she was camping, which I understand. But after we actually got in touch, Liana offered to call an exterminator. I replied saying we won't be home until later for the exterminator to come in. I asked when would the exterminator be coming in so we can schedule our time for the extermination. I waited another 24 hours to receive another bad signal message. Nothing was fixed during our stay. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not bad except the wifi issue.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This apt is in a GREAT location near everything in the city, within 5min walkd to lots of food places set up is cute just as in the pics, 24hr doorman so it's safe nd easy to let someone know if there is anything wrong, surprisingly quiet, our host left us with everything from the Wi-Fi password to laundrycard to use during our stay. Valeria was super nice nd replied :) highly recommend this apt!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was our first stay in an airbnb, we enjoyed our stayed and very satisfied with our choice to stay at this airbnb. The house was clean, enough bathroom space for multiple guests and the neighborhood was quiet. We didn't have too bad of a time parking in front of the house. There was excellent communication and felt very safe and comfortable in the home. A little hot upstairs in the summer, however, there is a portable air conditioner in the master bedroom and fans & windows in every bedroom. I will definitely stay at LaToya's place again!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We had a wonderful time in your apartment maria! It fitted our needs perfectly. The bed and the couch were very comfortable. You might want to fix the extension of the couch though. It is not correctly attached underneath the couch on the right side. That's why the extension tends to drift away from the couch when laying on it. I think it's very easy to fix by changing the position of a little U-Shaped device underneath that is now attached underneath but pointing to the wrong side and being to far at the back of the couch. That should fix it.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a nice stay at Shahana's house, it was comfortable and had everything we needed, and she was very welcoming and helpful. The area wasn't bad, we never felt worried, but I can see why some people might. It took us about one hour to reach Manhattan, the house wasn't as close to the subways/trains as I had hoped, but it worked out fine anyway.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I've booked this room for a night before the night I arrived, it was a fast respond. It was flexible time to check-in, which is good. The room was very clean and neat. The person I think is her son is very nice, he explained clear to me. There was one little bad thing was the noises from the outside if the windows are open.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I would’ve put zero stars because that place was terrible. My niece is 4 years old and her room is bigger than this place she tried to get me to stay at the place smells bad and she’s rude . I strongly suggest you don’t stay here . Rip off I want my money back!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>You will be given no more than what you pay for. When I arrived I couldn't find the address and the host wasn't helpful. The communication was bad.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>FIVE LIES: STAY AWAY! Short version: We (3 people) stayed there Oct 5-9, 2018. - Comfortable and clean room. - Well-equipped bathroom, but the bathtub had hairs the entire time (no cleaning service), its side was moldy, and the vents had caked over mold and mildew. No hand towel – there was a DISGUSTING rag that looked it had never been cleaned. Window curtain transparent. - Close proximity to subway, but terrible neighborhood: undesirables and strange people, worse than Haarlem - my girlfriend and her adult son said they wouldn’t feel safe walking alone. - Hostess (mom) slow to respond to texts and emails, and did not receive us (teen son did). - No key provided for room (this was not mentioned in ad – they falsely claimed it was). I had laptop that I had to carry with me at all times since we couldn’t lock the door. Also, the son said the last customer lost the key, a lie since they do not give out keys. First lie. - Hostess had her teen son tell us we could call her to open door for us. The first time, they did, but the second time, mom and daughters had a hissy fit. They also claimed son never made us that offer, and he denied saying it: 2 more lies. - The rude daughter also accused us of making noise in the hallway at 3am. I asked her to show it to me on the camera. She couldn’t, of course. A fourth lie. - Hostess told me she only has one dog when her daughter visits from New Jersey. Well, they had 2 dogs who barked till midnight every night. A fifth lie. - Their cat came to visit our bathtub: very unhygienic. - They have a very small child who stayed up till almost midnight, and they made noise (crying, heavy walking, dropping things on floor, barking, loud tv…) till very late at night. - These people watched tv very loudly till 2-3 am every night. Rooms were quiet, but hallway leading to washroom and microwave oven were very noisy. - We are very civil and reasonable people, but sadly, hosts are not. Long version: Shahana took 7 hours to answer 2 texts from me on the way to NYC. Room is clean, decent and beds are comfortable. Could’ve used a dresser for clothes…A/C works well. The bathroom is well equipped, but the bathtub’s side was moldy, the bathtub had hairs that were never removed (no cleaning service) and the vents had caked over dust and dirt. Plus, they never provided a hand towel. There was a mini DISGUSTING rag that looked it had never been cleaned. Also, the curtain on the window was transparent. Microwave and fridge in basement hallway clean and usable, but only one chair in central area where they are, no table, no counter, no sink, no cupboard, etc... The 3 of us (adults) arrived at 4:30 PM, and a young man opened door for us (he said he’d just woken up – they said he’s a teenager). His mom Shahana, the AirBnB owner, didn’t receive us. She just showed her head and smiled (“Hi!”), and she was giving the son instructions, and at one point was yelling at him. He said there is no key to room since last customer lost it, and it costs over $100 to replace (???). It’s not a real key, more like a pin, and the lock is like a closet door lock. He also said there is no garbage can in room, and to use the small one is common bathroom (it filled up quickly by all guests). He said to use a plastic bag for garbage (we didn’t have any, and they wouldn’t give us one) – he said buy something and use the bag! He also said there is no key to room. This was not mentioned in the AirBnB listing. When I later showed it to the rude sister, she had nothing to say. Then, he just said “I’m busy and have to leave now (I thought he had just woken up). When you leave, lock the door. When you return, ask my mom to open the door for you.” Awkward misinformed son, lazy uncaring hostess. That evening, no soap in dispenser and no hand towel in bathroom. She said she’d add the soap, and also some toilet paper WHEN THE FIRST ONE FINISHES (LOL). Well, she did eventually add the TP. She also said she won’t put a hand towel since bathroom is shared by people (so what???). I wonder why, then, she doesn’t provide one hand towel per room…or a common paper towel roll to wipe hands or anything else. We walked around the area on Pitkin street. Let’s just say this area is inhabited by many undesirables, some strange people, a very loud and low-class area with many under-privileged people. It has a McDonald, a Subway’s, a KFC, a Chinese “buffet” and a Pizza Hut, mostly take-out food. No real restaurants. Tons of stores for under-privileged people… My lady friend and her adult son said they wouldn’t venture out alone in the evening. This is worse than the Brooklyn equivalent of Haarlem… When we returned, the son opened the door for us… In the evening, at 11:40PM, 2 dogs started barking as another guest was arriving. Shahana had said, amongst other things, that she doesn’t have any dogs, and she only has one dog when her daughter visits from NJ. Well, it looks like they have 2 dogs, not one like she had claimed, and they barked till midnight every night. Other guests’ comments zlxo mentioned the 2 dogs. It looks like her daughter and her 2 barking dogs visit her often… Next morning (Saturday), we left and locked the room, but I had forgotten something inside. It was 9:30AM. I texted Shahana to ask we be let in, and her daughter comes down and says we can’t be bothering them “early...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Was just ok. Below average. One thing was little bad that even drinking water was not provided by the host during the entire stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is the bare minimum of accommodation, if you are desperate and want to save money as a priority. Had i known how bad it was, i would never have booked it. The area felt unsafe to walk around. The host ignored my messages and refused to even welcome me and sent her son to do it. No support or flexibility was given by the host to move to another room as the one i was given was very noisy that it was hard to sleep peacefully.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Angel was a great host.  He was very accommodating in meeting me to hand over the keys.  The apartment itself is great and is huge for a studio in NYC.  The place was very clean, comfortable, and welcoming.  Best of all is the location.  There are countless restaurants, bars, sights, parks, etc. all within a short walk.  The L train is right on the corner and super convenient.  I don't have a bad thing to say and highly recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Such a cute home in such an AMAZING area. So conveniently located! The host was kind, calm, helpful and really amazing to work with. I felt so bad arriving so late but we made it work. Her home was very clean and the room had everything I needed. It was perfect for a place to sleep between wanderings in NYC and even to just come back and catch your breath between adventures if needed. Her pup is super cute and the dogs she sits are incredibly sweet. They really do stay in their own area (though I would never mind waking up with a sweet pup on my bed), but privacy is really excellent. If I make it back to NYC I'll be asking her for advice on yoga and dance studios, too. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This place is a great value for the location and space you get! Very spacious room, safe location, and communicative host. You really can’t go wrong with booking this place and I would definitely stay here again.\n</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The location of the brownstone apartment is really unbeatable.  You are right next to the subway station and only a block from Central Park.  Great restaurants and bars are minutes by walking.  Louise is a very nice host and good to talk to.  The bed was comfy and room spacious.  We did not use the kitchen.    This was our first time staying in an Airbnb while the owner was home.  It was fine and presented no awkward moments LOL.   We did have to pretend to be out of town family/friends as there has been some controversy regarding Airbnb.  One night when we got home there was a nasty note in the hall about the police evicting sublet guest!  Nothing ever came of it but I am afraid it will only get worse.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It was our first visit to America and choice of housing was very important that, would not spoil the impression of the country. We are glad that it is not wrong! The apartment is located in a cozy quiet Brooklyn , 5 minutes to the subway, a lot of the shops nearby. Apartment owners are very friendly and considerate, helped us in all our requests. All very clean and tidy. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sandra was an outstanding and very kind host. She was helpful and carrying. Me and my girlfriend came to the apartment at 10PM because of bad traffic and she was very understanding. I totaly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>My boyfriend and I traveled to New York for New Year’s and chose to stay in Brooklyn to avoid the craziness of Manhattan. Sandra was great! She was prompt, friendly and very helpful to us with anything we needed. She honored our reservation and still had the place ready for us on time, even despite having suffered a tragic loss in her family just a day before we got there. As far as the space, it was pretty much what you see in the pictures. Pretty cozy, full kitchen and bathroom and a super convenient location. About a 15-20 minute ride to JFK and a couple blocks walk to the Rockaway pkwy/Canarsie train Station. We basically took the L train from there to anywhere we needed to go the whole time we were there. It was very easy to get around. There’s also a ton of restaurants and stores all over the area that are a short walk from the house. Only a couple of minor issues...I wasn’t able to plug the bathtub to have a bath so I’m not sure if  the plug is broken or I just did it wrong...and the shower knob is a little weird, the hot side gives you cold and vice versa. And also, the bed was extremely hard and not comfortable for us at all, so we didn’t sleep too well while we were there. The walls are pretty thin and folks in the upstairs unit who I think might live there(?) were quite loud at times, they also came in and out a lot throughout the night which could be irritating to some because you can hear the front door opening and closing clearly from inside the apartment. Overall, though, we enjoyed our stay and these little things really didn’t bother us much. We felt safe and comfortable the whole stay and besides a little noise from the neighbors, it was a quiet and private space for us while we weren’t out and about. I would book Sandra’s place again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not a bad spot for a layover scenario, though bare minimum and 5-story walk up with no elevator. I forgot that you don’t always get what you pay for in NYC!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The home is great, clean and comfortable. Roman was nice and accommodating. However, he did not give me the proper refunds. The first time I booked the place it was $524 for two nights, then we decided to stay one more night and I gave him a month an half notice, with a additional charge of $368. About a week later I told him we cant stay longer so I wanted to keep the original 2 night for only $524. Roman responsed back thats ok. I even gave him the update of my confirmation on the day of checkin and i did told him the amount as well. He only refunded me $220, which is ridiculous, he didnt let me know ahead, his response was it was that he cant control the price of the two night that I originally booked, so it increased to $672, i was so disappointed and was not awared. Wish i was informed ahead. The sad part is he does have control of it, its not that he doesnt. I felt like I got lied to and robbed. So if you do booked this place, be very very careful of booking with his charges, make him sent you the result before confirming. My stay was good but ended with a bad feeling. As for me, will never come back. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A very very nice place to stay if you are in Queens. Definitely not meant for people wanting to travel into Manhattan often. Also- it’s important to read the house rules. We missed the part about not being able to flush toilet paper until we were checked in and that was really the only bad part about the stay. Overall, would definitely recommend. Plenty of space and the master bedroom was so comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>If you're looking for something bad about this place, here it is.  It's so great that you won't want to leave the apartment to see the city.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This apartment was not as advertised. There was no air conditioning which in the middle of a new york summer was inconvenient especially as there were only 4 small windows. There were 3 ineffective fans which didn't reduce the humidity or circulate the air. The apartment also smelt quite badly and even with all the windows open and fans on the smell still remained. The smell was also particularly overwhelming when coming back to the apartment after it had been shut all day. The floor was also extremely creaky and loud in the hallway, simply walking through the apartment at night would wake up other family members. The person in the upstairs apartment was awake and walking around at all hours (even 3am) and you could hear every footstep. The beds were very uncomfortable to the point where my son had to sleep on the lounge his back was so sore. The worst aspect was the fact that we had to spray the whole apartment with flea spray as my wife and daughter both woke up with flea bites. After this and washing all the sheets the bites stopped. I would definitely not recommend this apartment. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Aj is the best. Extremely clean and hospitable. The room is private and clean, you won’t find a better deal in the city. He’s honest, clean, and quiet. But he’s also able to show you the hot spots and night clubs if you have a weekend stay, at least that was my experience. Great and safe location, train is literally right there with a bar and food truck close by. Aj is a superstar, I came to NYC for the first time and hoped to just have fun and be safe. He did so much more than that, he helped make my stay adventurous and relaxed. I wasn’t expecting him to be so great, I read the other reviews and thought AJ couldn’t be this cool. I was wrong, believe the hype this is the room to rent in the greatest city in the world.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Cosy and we’ll located. Loved the decor. It is in an old tenement building and comes with the funkiness inherent in that. If you want something clean, sleek and modern, you’re in the wrong place</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Estuvimos 15 días y lo pasamos muy bien!! Daniella y Steef son muy buenos anfitriones, simpáticos, amables, dispuestos a ayudarte en todo lo que necesites. Gracias a Anne (mamá de Daniella) que nos fue a recibir el sábado, después de que a último momento nos cambiaran el vuelo del avión y llegáramos antes de lo previsto. El departamento es muy cómodo, amplio, como se muestra en las fotos. El aire acondicionado y el refrigerador nos vino muy bien para aplacar el calor que hizo durante nuestra estadía. Nos gustó mucho el barrio y nos movilizamos muy bien en subte y colectivo. No tuvimos ningún inconveniente, si bien es cierto que no volvíamos de madrugada. Gracias Steef por alcanzarnos hasta el subte, las valijas estaban realmente pesadas!! De nuevo, gracias a los dos!! Esperamos volver!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our family really enjoyed staying at this rental. First, the space: There's a front room, a small bedroom, a kitchen and a bathroom. The apartment was extraordinarily clean, and the restored paneling and wood floors are lovely. The bathroom is renovated with high-end fixtures and tile. The host: Benjamin was helpful and considerate, communicating effectively. He left a few snacks and some drinks in the fridge to welcome us, as well as some ground coffee to use with the provided French press, which we appreciated. He invited us to join his family for a backyard movie night, and even offered to give us his street parking space so we wouldn't have to worry with moving for the street sweeper, which was very generous. The neighborhood: This part of Bed-Stuy is about one-fifth gentrified (with the house containing this rental definitely one of the pioneers), so the neighborhood is really culturally diverse. There's lots of hip-hop music and clusters of people hanging on the corner, old guys giving back-slapping hugs and grandmas living in houses that could use work alongside some hipsters and young families renovating some of the old brownstones. At first it felt rough around the edges, but a day's experience made us feel comfortable and safe. The beer-and-sandwich bodegas that have been there since the beginning of time still predominate, but now there's a hipster coffee shop and even two new organic neighborhood groceries. Everyone seems to tolerate each other well, and it makes for a really interesting place. Overall, we felt like staying in this neighborhood lent a richness to our stay that we wouldn't have gotten at some generic hotel in Manhattan. The walk to the subway isn't bad, and the ride to Manhattan is pretty quick. Benjamin explained that the rest of Brooklyn is pretty drivable, and we took advantage, heading over to Park Slope one night for dinner. Street parking is free, but you do have to watch hydrants and remember to observe alternate-side parking, explained on signs on each block. No one bothered our BMW over the four days it was parked there, though we picked up a screw in our tire from some ongoing renovation or other. :-) Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Highly recommend staying at Bellamy’s place. Clean and stylish. Great for a couple. Bus to JFK (terminal 5) is only a block away which was perfect. A bit of a walk to local subway stations but not too bad. Close (also a block away) to grocery stores... overall. Great Place. Would book again. </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Much worse than expected. If you go one block over you feel very unsafe. We left before our time due to the TERRIBLE cheap uncomfortable furnishings. My husband could not sleep the old foam mattress sinks you in the middle and the couch feels horrible! You have been warned stay anywhere else in the city. We were also woken up after being jet lagged by UPS trying to deliver their packages of the Airbnb host. I had a hard time getting in, directions were not clear. I was messaging with the host then tried to call and they didn’t answer!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had. Brittan's apartment was just as described .. very spacious and quite luxurious. It was very hot when I was in New York, but the apartment was really cool, with an excellent centralized air con system. Brittan was not in New York when I arrived, but the key pick  up instructions were very clear, and she was easily available on her cell. I was working in Manhattan during my stay, and while the commute took me around 40 minutes to Grand Central, it was not too bad. There are two good restaurants just a few steps away, and ... altogether ... this was a really cost effective way to stay in New York.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Shahana's place was nice and comfortable, it has good air conditioning and there were clean towels, cups and bedsheets for us there. The house is situated on the border of a good and a bad suburb of Brooklyn and the southern neighbourhood looks sketchy. Even then the walk to the metro is through the good neighbourhood and walking home at 1am felt safe and is well lit. Public transportation is great, there are plenty of ways to get to Manhattan. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>First thing is make sure to read reviews. If a person has one bad review, take heed. Giving them the benefit if the doubt, I decided to give them a chance. Plus the cost per night allowed me the option to travel(emergency) within my budget. I'm quite sure they have  better options, as thier is about three floors in the building; but for the value of $42 a night you get what you pay for.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A bad experience using Airbnb. Shahana should change the place’s host name  or add a collaborator as I almost never interacted with her but I did with her young relative. I asked Shahana for an iron ( included in the amenities) in the morning but she never replied and when she arrives at checkout time, she only says “it’s time. Leave the room! I took my medicine”. Totally ruined my day cause I couldn’t find an iron outside.  They won’t provide you keys for anything so be prepared to ask them to open the door every time you go out. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Was given Shahanna's place as a suggestion by an AirBnB rep, when my previous host canceled 2 days before arrival back in NYC.   Better than expected for the area.  Rooms are very comfortable and shared space is often cleaned by hosts.  Not bad for my first AirBnB experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My friend and I stayed for 16 days at Gina`s place. Once we stepped into the unit, we got amazed by the way the place was arranged , cleaned and well-prepared to receive the new guests  .We felt home from the very beginning ,the thing that made our spirits quite high till the end of the trip and gave us a sense of relief and comfort ,something we badly needed at that time because it was our first visit to New York .We found lots of food items in the fridge and shelves with a note from Gina asking us to use these items as a hospitality from the host, we also found two tickets for theater and two more tickets for a concert ,in addition to a bus and metro card  loaded with a very considerable amount of money on and ready to use something we never expected. Gina is a very organized lady as she puts a note on every single thing in the unit to make everything easily accessible. Honestly ,she is exceptionally amazing host .she is very accommodating and welcoming along with her husband Mr. G who used to meet us with a big smile on his innocent face and their very helpful son Chris. She also used to check on us occasionally to make sure that everything is OK. This adds up to the big advantage of the location that happened to be within reach of nearly everything ( public transport , food markets , parks ,  health care center and many other utilities).I will never think of an alternative to Gina`s place , if I intend to visit new York again either by myself, with a friend or with my family. Gina`s place is a real home and she is a professional host.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wat een geweldig prettig huis om in te verblijven. Het is een rustige en vriendelijke wijk in Brooklyn. Twee badkamers voor zes volwassen personen is perfect evenals de drie slaapkamers. Het was netjes en schoon. Er worden steeds wat handige spullen achtergelaten door de vorige huurders waardoor er een voorraadje staat van allerlei spullen. Fantastische gastvrijheid: Erin en Christian zijn zo ontzettend vriendelijk dat als ze naar Nederland komen ze welkom zijn in ons huis. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Boligen var nøjagtig som beskrevet i annoncen. Tre fine soveværelser, 2 badeværelser og en stue/køkken. Perfekt til 3 par der rejser sammen. Erin har været god hjælp undervejs i vores ophold. Hun responderede hurtigt på diverse spørgsmål. Nabolaget var stille og roligt. Metro 1 minut væk, med direkte forbindelse til manhattan. Tager dog lige 30 min ca.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay. Space was perfect for a group and allowed opportunity to catch up and spend time together. As described, location doesn't have a lot to offer. Easy access to other parts of Brooklyn by car or train. Not much to walk to which was too bad. The double beds were fine but the bunk beds were quite uncomfortable for our friends. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mooi ruim appartement met alle denkbare voorzieningen. Vooral de twee badkamers met toilet zijn heel handig. Metro om de hoek. Grote supermarkt op 5 minuten lopen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Clean, spacious, comfortable apartment in a centrally located neighborhood. Parking on the street wasnt bad- we were almost always able to find a spot not too far away. Traveling with young children, this apartment was perfect for our needs. Host is helpful and responsive if any issues do arise. No complaints.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rustam was an excellent host. He has great recommendations on what ever you need and answered all our questions in timely manner.  Everything from Food clothes transportation etc. The location is ideal if you really want to experience Bushwick and all it has to offer. The building is really nostalgic and beautiful with a roof top that has a gorgeous view and an amazing breeze. My boyfriend and I had great time at his place we were there for a whole week and we loved the private bathroom. It was super clean and modern, the bedroom is cozy with really high ceilings, the 24 laundry place, the countless bodegas with yummy sandwiches, awesome dive bars and even the bushwick public library is all right at your fingertips.  Convenience was key here and Bushwick has this  vintage barrio like charm that made for a really fun and unique experience on the east coast. I highly recommend this place if you want to have an authentic adventure and submerge yourself inside a city that’s rapidly changing and is truly unique. This place is for those who can appreciate vintage clothes street art good coffee and intriguing characters. Also it’s super close to the train and going in  and out of the city wasn’t bad at all.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was fantastic & super accommodating.  Though I felt bad coming in super late at night Pat was more than understanding as long as I didn't wake everyone up.  Her hospitality was tremendous & could rival any 5 star hotel...that's why I gave her 5 stars!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Claire was very flexible with check-in and check-out. The place is exactly as described. Subway is within walking distance (5-10mins) and the neighborhood is pretty safe as well. We walked down from the subway to the place as late as 2AM and nothing bad happened. The place is great with bed, oven, microwave, sink and coffee-maker etc. As described, bathroom is really small.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Claire was a joy to communicate with, very friendly and accommodating. She was able to be flexible with check in and that made it so much more doable for us to make it out to Brooklyn. The room itself was clean, and as described. The bed was comfortable and Claire was there to check us in and show us around. The only aspects that would have been nice to know is that the studio apartment is in the basement of Claire's home. Because of this you can hear what is going on upstairs, which can be a downside if you like to sleep in. Also, we were unable to open the garden access door, which was a shame. We didn't ask Claire about it so it may have been something we were doing wrong. Overall, Claire was great and made our first airbnb experience a success. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We didn't interact a ton but Claire was super accommodating during our stay. The neighborhood was nice, a walk from the nearest subway but not bad at all & you can get to two stops very easily. It has most everything you need for a cozy stay: chromecast, microwave, mini fridge, toaster oven & hot plate.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not a bad place would not mind booking again  !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Place was not bad. Only problem was the area was a bit sketchy.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My watch has lost at my room, and I called 911 but it still didn't find. Moreover, the lock of my room is broken, everyone can open my room's door., so I don't know who took my watch.  This is a bad experience for me in this airbnb.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dom and his roommate were very friendly, welcoming, and interesting to speak with. They provided towels, soap, and maps of the city for us. The location of the apartment is ideal and even though there is a bar downstairs that plays live music - it's not really too bad in the actual bedroom.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Together with a friend I stayed at Dominique's private room to visit NYC for an extended weekend. Dominique was really nice and communicative. The arrival and check out was super easy. The apartment is located great, just a few steps to Times Square and Central Park. But also the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center is reachable within a few minutes walking distance. On the other hand it was quite noisy but that was not bad since we did not spend much time inside. Therefore, I can recommend his room for short trips, especially when you plan a lot of sightseeing and when you do not plan to spend much time in the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Annette is a polished, lovely (and stunning) woman whose jewel box of an apartment made for a comfortable stay.  Everything was spotlessly clean.  The warm, welcoming bedroom is all white, with a crystal chandelier, crushed velvet headboard, a queen bed with lusciously soft bedding, and a view of Central Park that was quite magical the night it snowed.  Annette provided bottled water and ear plugs, the latter because the street and building noises were often loud; I'm a heavy sleeper so they didn't bother me at all.  She cleared out a bureau drawer for the contents of my travel bag and gave me hangers for my clothes, plus an iron to touch up travel wrinkles.  Her shower worked very well, and I was grateful she provided a hair dryer.  But what impressed me most was her kindness the day I left.  Seeing me in distress with a bad cold I'd just contracted, she proactively gave me cold medicine to help me manage my trip home.  Thank you, Annette!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Unfortunately this was my first bad experience with an Air BnB.  Everything was fine until I reached out to Annette on  day of arrival. Annette has Check in time posted as 3 pm, but Annette changed check in several times due to her work schedule, even on arrival day. When I was unable to accommodate her frequently changing availability - she let me know that I would only be able to check in from 4:30-6pm. I asked if she offered self check in, she ignored the question with a flippant response of the hour and a half window. Second issue - Apparently she charges more for two people (my husband was with me) and was quite rude when she realized I was traveling with my husband  (i only paid for one person). I apologized for overlooking as I’ve booked air bnbs all over the world and never been charged an additional fee when traveling with my husband, my bad I will pay the difference. Annette said she didn’t know how much it was and that she was going into a meeting and would get back to me later. After all the back and forth and seeing how unwelcoming and cold she was, I requested to cancel. I felt uncomfortable spending an entire weekend in her home. She gladly offered a full cancellation but followed up with a few more temper tantrum texts. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Deirdre's place was perfect - exactly as described. Very nicely decorated - warm and inviting. My husband and I were in town for a wedding without our young children and actually got to sleep in past 6am. The bed was very comfortable (great sheets, too!) and although it's a moderately busy street and you can hear the subway a bit - it was relatively quiet as far as NY apartments go. Deirdre was very easy to work with - responsive and helpful. She was even able to accommodate a late check out request when we realized that most brunch spots don't open until 10am on Sundays. We only left about 20 min late but I felt bad. Overall - I would definitely stay there again! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Deirdre is a great host!   The place is exactly like described.  Me and my family ( my husband and two teenage kids) were staying in New York for 6 nights.   The apartment is very nice with all the amenities and very comfortable beds and soft linens.  The unit has a window AC for which we were very thankful as it was very hot during our stay.  It was very nice to be back to a cool apartment after a busy and hot day.  The place is very close to a metro which was very convenient for us.  We drove to New York and parked our van at one of the long term parking garages as it was easier/cheaper to buy unlimited weekly metro pass ($34 pp) and travel around N.Y. by metro.  There is a free public parking on a surrounding streets but you have to move the car on certain days and the spaces are very limited.  We did not want to be wasting our time trying to look for the free parking which is almost impossible to find.  To find a parking garage we download one of the parking apps on which you can see all the garages in the area and the cost.  A lot of time if you book on line you get the parking for 50% less if you book the same day.  It cost us $110 (had to pay $10 extra for oversized car-mini van) for 5 nights which was not bad price for the area. Since we arrived in NY on Sunday (there are parking meters on the 9th St.)  we were able to park in front of our apartment for free until Monday morning 8am as the parking is free on  Sundays.  We really enjoyed this apartment and would definitely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Accurate description of a cosy, local homie-from-home in Brooklyn.  Perfect for transport into Manhattan, and the immediate area is safe, with local colour and a few cool stores.  Bagels opposite, and Whole Foods is a 10 minute walk away.  A small amount of street noise but really not that bad at all - and all part of the experience!   As a base for exploiting it is ideal, and Deirdre is a great host.  Unlike many Airbnbs the bedding is decent and comfortable - nice touch.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Deirdre is a great host.  She responds quickly and is very helpful. The apartment is within half a block from the train, so it is easy access to the city. And the noise that Dierdre warns about is really not bad at all.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Such a great and cozy studio to stay at. The host was great as well. She was readily available to answer any questions immediately. Her hospitality really stood out. She welcomed us with treats and snacks for our stay. Sol was very thoughtful with providing us with all our of needs. our flight came in earlier than expected that day and we were allowed to check in earlier because the place happened to be available. I also locked myself out at 10pm and had to contact Sol. She immediately came down to open the door without making us feel bad about it. Overall, the studio was great. It was next to St. John’s University too so the ambiance felt safe. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice, quiet, and safe location to stay at while visiting NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stayed here for three nights during August 2018 with a party of five. The accommodations were great for a NYC borough. The neighborhood is a bit discerning but it is not too bad. Street parking can be difficult to be find sometimes, but is a available. The concierge was very helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I would  suggest not to choose this place at all. Had a terrible experience with the host . I have booked the apartment for 2 days  and was trying to reach the host in a week advance . the host doest even had the courtesy to reply back to  my messages . after lots of follows up he responded . I have informed the host about my flight delay due to bad weather and didn't got any acknowledgement  from him . he told us to collect the keys from shop below the apartment  which runs 24/7. The host never picks the call or even bothered to return the call. we landed and reached to the given address . we struggled to find anyone over there and after spending 2 hours we didn't able to find anyone and the host didn't picked his calls. we left the place and booked the hotel at Brooklyn. we have informed the Airbnb helpline staff  also they were also not able to reach him and finally cancelled the booking and gave us $50 credit . we have no use of $50 credit as we struggled a lot to find the hotel at 3am midnight . I must say the Host is disgraceful person . I would certainly  not recommend this property to stay . Extremely annoyed and terrible experience with the host . A complete Nonsense  host . if he can't respond then why did he has put his posting on Airbnb.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Place is dingier than photos represent. Two beds had bad springs. Front bedroom loud. Tub faucet broken.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>James is very friendly and easygoing. He waited for us 45 minutes as we took a wrong way to reach the apartment. The apartment is spacious, full of light, recently renovated and very clean. The location is great, in Hamilton Heights/ Sugar Hill.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>First time in NYC, and Peter's place was the perfect location to explore both Brooklyn and Manhattan. Loved the space and the neighborhood. The rooftop sunsets were pretty spectacular. You can't go wrong really. Stayed a whole month!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Min søn og jeg havde alletiders ophold i Loryns hyggelige lejlighed. Alt var som beskrevet, og Loryn gav os en hjertelig velkomt og viste os rundt i lejligheden og gav os gode råd. Alt var rent og pænt, badeværelse og køkken fungerede fint. Vi prøvede nogle af de lokale restauranter, som Loryn havde anbefalet, og de var virkelig gode. Loryn er en omsorgsfuld og \"\"professionel\"\"  vært og meget nem at kommunikere med. Efter en hel dag i centrum af New York</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The listing was exactly as described but once we arrived it was far more welcoming than we could have ever imagined. Due to my late arrival I was not able to actually meet Loryn but she was incredibly understanding and accommodating and ensured that we were properly squared away. Even after a couple of snafu's on our part, she was more than gracious. It says a lot about a person to feel such a warmhearted, kind, and positive energy without even physically meeting them. We loved the neighborhood and found it easy to explore Harlem and venture out as well. Loryn also provided us with information on recommended restaurants and coffee shops that were nearby and that was great. I could go on... but in short it was a great trip and staying at the 'Cozy Harlem Hideaway' was the double icing on top. The only bad thing is that my stay was far too short!  :-)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"The apartment is flawless but still my friend and i did not have any good experience at this place. The neighbour which also is the super treated us bad and with no respect from the minute we stepped into the building. She disrespected us with comments and acted like we were intruders. She talked to us in a very bad way and \"\"watched\"\" us in a very suspicious manner. We did not feel comfortable at all. When we left she also made false accusations to the renter</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay at Jan’s place was wonderful! It was very clean and cozy. It looked exactly like the pictures. Jan was quick and very helpful when corresponding before and during our stay. Our flight was delayed from bad weather and Jan was very accommodating and understanding. We didn’t get a chance to meet her but her husband was there when we arrived and he as very friendly and welcoming. The apartment was very close to two subway stops which was very convenient and it was in a lovely quiet area of Brooklyn. Great coffee shops and restaurants near by. We would definitely stay there again if we traveled to NY again. Highly recommended! \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We hebben een goed verblijf gehad bij Charlene. Een ruime kamer en prima gedeelde badkamer op de zelfde verdieping. Ook een leuke omgeving om te verblijven in de buurt. Veel winkels en eetgelegenheden en inderdaad vlak bij de metro. We hebben  zelf een kopje thee gezet kopjes zijn aanwezig. Je mag ook een magnetron gebruiken (wat wij niet gedaan hebben). Een avondje kletsen met mede loge's en Charlene was erg leuk. Ervaringen uitwisselen over het leven en new York dat maakt ons happy. Charlene is net als ons ook geïnteresseerd in universele energie en ze tipte ons over een heerlijk vegan restaurant. Thank you</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Pat was a friendly host! She welcomed us and gave us a good tour of where everything was located. The room was as described and the beds were comfortable. There were two other people staying there, but we hardly ever saw them because everyone was in and out exploring the city. We were invited to brunch the morning we were to check out, but unfortunately we had already left earlier in the morning. It was approximately a 10 minute walk to the nearest Subway, so not too bad. Good place to stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My experience was awesome! Pat is very nice and caring! My flight got in waaaay late (in the am) but Pat was very nice and understanding about it. She even made me breakfast the next morning! She keeps everything clean and orderly. It's like having your own apartment, you have your own privacy. Although, Pat does check in on you every once in awhile to make sure everything is alright. The area is safe and it's filled with lots of shopping. Grocery stores, pharmacy stores, food places near the subway, etc. Also, there's a laundry about 1 minute away. I had no problem going to Times Square. It took me about 40-45 minutes on the train and the ride really isn't bad! I definitely recommend staying here! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Pat was a wonderful host. We only stayed 2 nights so didn't see her much. It was nice to be able to arrive at 2am after exploring the city and having your own set of keys and private entrance. For the price, and hospitality, you can't go wrong if you're looking for a place to sleep and shower before heading out to the city. The shower is hot and the water pressure is excellent. There is a full kitchen and excellent wifi. The beds are soft and comfy. The neighborhood her house is in seems like a nice community. Overall a great first airbnb experience. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This listing is as described. I especially appreciated that the whole flat was kept very clean during our 3 night stay. We were always able to find nearby parking on the street. Terrance was very helpful when we were given the wrong keys; he left his meal to come and let us into our room. This place is a good value in a good location.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Michael is a fun and friendly host who provided prompt communication when needed throughout my stay. His apartment is just as advertised, and very clean. You won't go wrong staying with him! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Catia’s home is in a great location. Just a couple blocks from “the vessel” in Hudson yards and the high line. We walked to broadway shows which wasn’t bad even in the heat. The subway stop is very close and got us around the city quickly. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The flat was perfect for our six-night stay. It was clean and comfortable.  For our check-in Iryna waited for us out in the summer heat, and showed us to the flat, and provided some information on how to get around.  The bedroom is open which worked fine  for us, it makes the flat more spacious.  Location was great, it was very close to the green line, and a 12 min walk to the red line which is not a bad walk at all -- getting around the city even out to New Jersey for the PGA championship was very easy.  And if you are too tired to go out to get dinner after a long day of walking, there are a lot of options for delivery, which we did a couple of times.   Over all we had a nice stay, and it was a good and comfortable place to come home to after a tiring day of exploring the busy NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Iryna's place is in a great location, it's very close to the subway. It also feels like a safe neighborhood. I traveled with my friends and we would get home late and it didn't seem too bad. There's convenience stores near by and good food places too. Our host had great communication and was helpful. The pictures of her place are very accurate. What you see is what you get :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This space was nice and clean. We really felt that authentic New York loft look. Very continent, 2 minute walk from subway (a line that brings you straight to downtown). Maybe food stores around (McDonald’s: less than a minute walk, dunkin donuts, 99 cent pizza store and more. A lot of people told us to “stay safe” because the area but personally it wasn’t that bad. If you were to walk past 117th street toward 125 it was a little more crazier with people, so I wouldn’t recommend walking at night. I had a little bit of a challenge communicating with the host at first regarding check in directions, but after a while she responded. Overall the stay was good!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Although I never met Curtis, he did a great job explaining check in details and answering any questions I had prior to checking in. The apartment itself is decent, and the surrounding neighborhood seems nice too. The bathroom is a little small, but this ultimately wasn't a problem for me. Otherwise, I don't have anything bad to say about staying here. It's definitely a good option, and having the 103rd subway stop nearby was a good resource to have.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I didn't get the chance to meet Su-Ling or Michael, but they both were in communication and let me know what I needed to in order to get in. I didn't need anything during my stay but they made themselves available in case. The place is nice and as advertised. Very clean, in a quiet part of town. It's a couple of minutes walk to the subway stations, but not too bad. It took me about 45 mins total to get midtown from here. My only (minor) criticism is that the water pressure in the shower was a little low for my liking.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>En varm velkomst fra Michael var en en behagelig start på vores besøg. Lejligheden er pæn og ren med en fin stue, et moderne badeværelse og to udmærkede soveværelser. Køkkenet er rent, men ikke af en størrelse, der indbyder til den store madlavningskunst.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Didn't see Steve, but wasn't an issue. Wasn't at the apartment very much but the time we were there was great. The room was very nice, (although very sunny which is good or bad depending on if you're sleeping). Had a great stay overall!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Josh's place is in the perfect location.  One block from the subway, one block from riverside park, a few blocks from Central Park, one block from citi bikes, a supermarket and cafe are across the street - you cannot do wrong with location.  It was nice calling Josh's place home for a while.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was very dirty and badly tidy when we arrived with my husband and my 8 months son. The floor was clean in appearance, but when we looked under the bed there was a lot of dust. The inside of the cupboard was dirty and sticky, the fridge was awful and the stoves were unusable, the towel also dirty. The mattress had brown spots\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This apartment is exactly  like the  pictures  it is a perfect  position if you want to be  out of the busy centre but within  a few subway stops. You can get everywhere  very easily. We travelled with  3 kids and they loved  playing in the local  playground there was easily enough room for 6 of us the apartment has everything you could need. We had arranged to pickup the keys from  somewhere else and after abit of a panic found that they were left with the wrong names on the  envelope. At one point Aneela also insisted on us phoning her for emergency which turned out to be general info even though I  asked for  communication via email (for cost  reasons) before our arrival. Maybe a bit more organisation of information is needed before arrival of things like recycling and meeting up for walkthroughs just as we had a tight itinerary and didn't plan on this it wasn't too much hassle but just another  thing to try and fit in.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Our stay was fantastic. Host contacted us and arranged for us to get our keys. She even called after we arrived to make sure everything was alright. Place was exactly how it was described. Quiet neighborhood, close to food, shops and 2 blocks from Central Park. Only thing was the subway is 3 blocks away but still not too bad of a walk. I would highly recommend this place</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We spent 7 nights at Matham place and our overall experience was ok, but there are a couple of things to mention on the bad side. The place was as explained and location was very good, with a close subway station and many bars and restaurants around.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We have an amazing time in New York and Manuel's flat is close to subway, central park, shops and restaurants. The flat is spacious, clean and we got everything we needed in. Nothing bad to say about it, all was perfect and exactly like pictures.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a good stay! The place is near the Subway, so you can get to Manhattan quickly. We never had to wait for the shower because there are 2 badrooms. It was clean and had a very good bed. Would stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Eddie was quite responsive and welcoming: each bedroom door was covered by sticky notes with details about users' stay as well as WiFi instructions. It might have been a bad moment as he had to take personal time off but our experience was greatly influenced by it. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Eddie was simply great. His communication was top notch, everything we needed was there. Sharing a bathroom wasn't a problem at all for my friend and I. You won't end up having to share it with a ton of people. Working around each other isn't an issue. We had a tv to watch Netflix or YouTube, the beds were comfortable and provided with everything necessary. If you're going to be out and about in NYC while you're there, this place is great to stay in. Even then, it's not a bad place to hang out for a bit as we did a few times. We connected with another guest very well, which this place gives you the opportunity to do should others be staying there while you are. The location is central to so many places and delis. Parking can be a challenge but that's New York for you. Scoop up a spot on the street if you can, it's free.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I can divide my experience at Michael's place in two parts - one positive, one negative. In the first part, I have enjoyed staying in the flat. While it is oldish and not perfectly clean, the studio is generally well kept, with all necessary furniture and equipment. It is about 40 minutes from Washington Square by subway, but close enough to several tourist attractions. Michael has been generally helpful with ordinary issues and has contacted his assistants in case of need. The second part has been a very bad experience for me. The fridge stopped working. It actually kept switching itself on and off and there was clearly an electrical problem. For some reason, Michael stubbornly refused to acknowledge this and claimed that I switched the fridge off by mistake - which could not possibly be, if anything because I speak fluently both English and Spanish and there was no reason why I would do so. He came into the studio, turned the thermostat off and took a picture, arguing that that was evidence of my bad behaviour. I have had to turn to Airbnb, sending them videos and pictures showing that the fridge was really malfunctioning. Airbnb was very helpful and in the end Michael realised that the fridge had to be replaced. I do not understand why he would insist that the fridge worked, when it was not true. All in all, it took about two weeks, or a bit more, to sort out the problem. I was in NYC for work reasons, so it was not exacly pleasant to waste time on this.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This rental started off on the wrong foot when I walked in and it was freezing cold in the middle of December because the window had been left open and heat off in 20 degree weather.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Luke was very communicative and responsive. There's only a view of the other side of the brick building from the apartment, there is clomping noise from upstairs at times, and the apartment is way up at 188th St. but it is roomy, modern, cozy, the subway is close by and the noise upstairs isn't that bad and stopped around bedtime.  Good value for the money.  We'd certainly stay there again. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Staying in Eddie's house was the only bad thing of my experiences in New york. I shouldn’t have ask for a room if i need a private space. Bed was comfort, room was cozy, well furnished for travelers, also spacious. Eddie was hospitable and very kind person but I felt discomport during my stay. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I am a regular visitor to Eddie’s place. His place is clean and Eddie is very reliable. He also gives me good information/advice about New York. So, each time when I come, I find something new about The City. This time I tried one of his bikes to check around the neighbourhood. I know that I need to adapt myself to the bike environment. But, not too bad. I had a great time with a feeling of “Living in New York!”  Well, looking forward to exploring more about The Big City on my next visit. Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a wonderful stay at Shahana's home. She and her family were very accommodating and the room was clean and well kept. I had the privacy that I was looking for in renting a room.  I am from Brooklyn, so the area wasn't that bad to me. If you do not plan to rent a car, the bus stop is right in front of her home that can take you to the subway.  When I return to NY I would gladly stay with Shahana and her family again! If you are a late sleeper that won't work for you. I think there is a daycare upstairs and you can here the pitter patter of the little ones early in the morning. I came alone, but I have 4 children so it didn't bother me.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed at James’ place for a few days while I made a permanent move out to NY. James was super friendly, great at communicating and able to answer all my questions perfectly. Room was nice, bathroom was nice. Good spot for the few days I needed. Only thing to note, it’s on the 4th floor of a walk up so you’ll have to carry your luggage up but it’s not too bad</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I would stay there again and again! Can't say one bad thing about my experience</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Agatha is very kind and welcoming, and my stay here over all was nice. I just have two complaints. There are communal bathrooms on the floor and the condition of which is pretty bad. Its nothing the host has control over but its to be noted. Secondly there isnt AC so it was pretty warm in the room at night.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is clean, the bed it’s not showed in the announcement, it’s very small, it’s not bad, but you don’t have idea until you get there. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was wonderful house. All of cooking tools exist. Nice location to central park and public transportation. However.when we arrive the condition in bathroom was little bit bad. The water in baths drained very very slowly. But the host answered our askking for and fixed it. Totally, I like this house.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Listing was very accurate! Room and linen were clean, beds were comfy and AC worked great! The room had a small bowl with chocolates which was a nice touch. The bathroom already had shampoo, conditioner and body soap which was nice and the kitchen included a water dispenser and Kuerig Machine with free coffee pods. I had access to get in and out of the apt as needed and would definitely stay again. Only problem was street parking but I did stay on a weekend so I imagine it was bad timing.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Angela lives downstairs from the rooms she rents. She is very nice. She makes herself available to her guests and is very personable without being intrusive. Parking on the weekend is no problem. There is a great diner (Bucaneer) and a Walgreens 2 blocks down. The space is clean. The beds are comfortable. No TV. There is a kitchenette with pots, pans, dishes, utensils, etc. and a coffee maker with coffee, tea, hot chocolate, sugar and dry creamer. It is possible to cook on the 2 burner cook top. There are 3 mini refrigerators. I say all this to point out that the picture of the kitchen does not accurately portray the kitchen there. Most important, I forewarn anyone considering this listing about something I somehow missed. There are 3 bedrooms (sleeping up to 12 people) which could be potentially rented at one time, SHARING ONE BATHROOM!! I didn't know I would be sharing the bathroom and kitchen. I thought I was renting a tiny apartment for myself and my son. I feel the description and pictures are somewhat misleading. I could never go back there knowing I would be sharing the bathroom. Other than that, it is a great rental choice. But because of that, I have to give it a bad review. This was my first experience with an airbnb rental. I have learned that I have to ask questions. I already have a house reserved through airbnb for my next trip. Having an entire house will be quite a different experience. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Angela was very hospitable. Communication was quick. Her place is an ideal place for anyone traveling and doesn’t mind sharing a space with other fellow travelers as well. She had great personal touches to the place which made it feel like home. The place was far from most attractions but she had a busy stop down the street. New York’s public transport was great so that wasn’t too bad. Would def stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Angela and Ricardo were very welcoming and understanding. They were always ready to help and they were very friendly. The listing description was very accurate. The room was exactly like the pictures, and it was very well- maintained and clean. The neighbourhood was very quiet and safe and it is very close to La Guardia airport. However, the subway station was a bit far away, but it was not as bad if the bus was taken.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Angela was a pleasant welcoming hostess.  The room was as advertised, and met my expectations.  Wifi was available allowing me to view media or listen to music.  Driving wasn't bad in this burough, and parking wasn't a large challenge either.  I highly recommend the East River Ferry as an alternative transpo to Manhattan- relaxing and easy.  IF you are a light sleeper and don't intend to get up early, you may hear the drone of the planes taking off by 8am.  My daughter wasn't awakened, but I was.  The Keurig coffee machine was a nice touch!!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room was nice and clean. I Was able to check in with no hassle. However, the room did not have a T.V. so it felt like once we were in our room we could only sleep unless we had our electronic devices to entertain us while we relax in bed. The beds were not as comfortable and cushioned as I would have liked. The bedding was only thing sheets and no comforters.  The bus routes were easy and convenient. I did learn on my last day that the Q72 takes you to the train station at Junction Ave and you are able to ride that all the way to Time Square!! Before then I caught 2 busses to Harlem then a train to Time Square, time wasted!! So I hope that was helpful. Overall the stay was not bad, just basic and to the point.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Coming here I was skeptical about the location, but I was wrong. This property is on a quite, safe well lit and a central street with plenty of parking. The property is well kept and has numerous nice hotel-like touches. The hostess is awesome and super helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fatu and the the other lady are really very nice and kind people. Whenever we had questions they were helpful. I think the location of the house is safely. Apartment and furniture was pretty good. Key Food and various small shops were close to the house. The wifi was rather bad but all in all we were completely satisfied and our accommodation next time will be definitely the same. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fatou’s Crown Heights room was clean and she was very nice and got me out of a bind. The subway is a few blocks away but if you want experience real Brooklyn, this is the way to go. It’s a quiet neighborhood, and the walk up isn’t bad either; Manhattan is a few minutes away and the Brooklyn Museum is only a ten minute walk! She was very kind, I was out all the time during my stay but when I saw her she was very nice and warm. She’s a great host!</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Everything went well. Loved the decor -- the room has a Great Gatsby/1920s style. The bathroom is shared with other guests but was never a problem. The neighborhood seemed slightly worse than I expected but was fine. It was easy to schedule a time to check into the house. Overall a good experience. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Lesson Learned. I’ve always heard Airbnb can be hit or miss but I took a chance and booked a room in Williamsburg, NY with Charles. Charles is very communicative and provides advance notice of check in with instructions, etc which is nice. I felt confident going in before my trip. Price was fair and the pictures depicted a carefree and clean space with bright, modern, and airy surroundings and furnishings. It is a walk up obviously but not the worst just two flights up really. What you don’t see in the pictures is that the apartment is very well located in Williamsburg. What you don’t see in the pictures are the small cafes and nightlife right near by – we’re talking “at the corner”. What you don’t see in the pictures is the proximity to the parks and waterway with amazing views of the city. But what you also don’t see in the pictures unfortunately is the smell, the condition of the bedding from guest to guest and if that isn’t enough you risk personal security. After traveling all day arriving in NY in the evening, I walk up with 3 pieces of luggage in all and find the place stifling, smelly, dank and dark and the furnishings aren’t even the same! The dark of course was because of the hour in the evening, but what I couldn’t get over was the smell. If you’ve ever walked in to a fitness room after a very intense class, or you’ve forgotten your wet laundry to dry in the washer, you know the smell I’m talking about. And given the temperature in August (since the A/C was left off – why? Who knows?), the smell was PUNGENT at best. Horrible! Couple that with a duvet cover or similar (not really sure since I didn’t want to touch it) piled in a heap at the end of the bed like an afterthought – maybe that was the cause of the smell? Dirty or moldy bedding? I’ll never know. The bedding on the bed was basically a sheet covered in another duvet – very thin (I touched it enough to pull back slightly to see if the bed was even clean since the smell was so bad). I have stayed in accommodations all over the world, France, England, Austria, Peru – the list goes on. This place ranks second in the list of the worst places I have stayed in all my travels. I’ve only actually left 3 accommodations in all my travels over the last 40 years and this was one of them. I dropped my bags in the room long enough to seek fresh air but when I approached the back patio that I had seen in the pictures so quaint and peaceful, I realize the back door is just hanging off a thin chain with a gap that a person could easily fit an arm through to unlatch and you could hear all of the noise from the street below. The door was a screen door with glass insert – very shabby and easily broken off if you really wanted to. I have several friends in NY and I’ve always thought they were slightly paranoid about safety but after seeing the state of this door right down the hall from my room, I realized how right they are to be concerned about safety when all that stands between you and the outside world is a flimsy door hanging from a single door chain too long to keep someone from pushing in. No wonder there’s a key lock on the bedroom door. Charles tried to pass off the dank, moldy smell by telling me it was Murphy’s Oil Soap, never offering an explanation for the rest. HA! Oh, and I should have turned on the air, he says. Since when should the guest make the accommodations hospitable? Should I also have re-laundered the bedding, swept the floors, replaced the door, called a locksmith, and ordered new furniture??? And since when does Murphy's smell like armpit!! Very sad attempt to escape his responsibility as a host. What a fool he thinks we are. Shameless!! Thanks to Charles and his misrepresentation or neglect of his home, I had no other option than to spend the next 2 hours scrambling for alternative accommodations. Now, picture me doing that at 9pm in NYC. Two hours later I was checking into my new beautiful hotel in Manhattan. Never again. Don’t waste your money or your time. Charles’ standards unfortunately do not meet with even a midline standard in my book. The photos will not give you the full \"\"picture\"\". Don't be fooled! Or</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Johnny’s place was by far the best place I have ever stayed in NYC.  And one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed in. His place looks amazing on online but it is even better in person! Johnny was fun and easy to talk with and he had absolutely everything you could need when staying in New York. I was there for a conference and his place was just a few blocks from the convention center. His place was also close to a subway station and great restaurants, bars and authentic NYC vibe just around the corner. You cannot go wrong booking his place in fact I would say if you don’t, your making a mistake. Johnny’s place will be where I stay next time my travels bring me to New York.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mr. Peter have an amazing team as a family, they made us feel like home. The experience with them was way better than we were expecting, not only for the apartment which it’s exactly as you see in the pictures but also because of it’s convenient location. These people are really concerned about you having a confortable stay. Nothing bad to say at all, we are absolutely happy.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>nice place small but not bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>If you're looking for a place to stay in the heart of NYC, this is it. Just minutes away from Times Square, restaurants, broadway and shopping, all within walking distance. The room is small, which is to be expected, a little warm but does have an AC unit that eventually cools it down. There are 4 flights of stairs so be prepared for that but not bad. Marcello is very kind, was there to greet me once I arrived, prompt to respond. All in all I had a great, authentic NYC experience!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room was lovely and just as described, and our hosts were kind and unobtrusive, and accommodating for us and our dogs. It's a bit of a trek from the city, but not bad at all. Upstairs gets a little loud in the morning, but also, not a big problem for us.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place it's really bad guys I cannot understand why some people say positive things.  the neighbourhood is so unsafe very far from everything, SHANANA just want money when your time  is over she will act like the worst person ever. Trust DONT COME HERE.  ITS A VERY BAD IDEA. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is Perfect, super clean, the location is closed to public transportation, I can give 5 star for that but her son was the one who received me when I got to the place he was nice and friendly. My problem was late at night they lock the entrance at night for security, so if you want to get out at night you need to let them know so they can unlocked the entrance door. I had a bad experience with the host’s husband. he looks upset when i was requesting for unlock the door at night. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>When I searched for an appartement, I had the feeling I had to stay at Ivan's place. My sixth sense wasn't wrong!\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>If you are okay with simply renting a bedroom in an occupied apartment, then you can do no wrong with staying at Crysdian's place. It's a great deal and literally a one-minute walk from the A-train. From there, you're 30 minutes to the heart of the city. The apartment is clean, Crysdian is kind, and his dog is adorable.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Carmen was a great host. It was my first time to travel solo and to use airbnb, I think I didn't make a bad decision at all in staying with them. She's very welcoming and gave everything I needed as I stayed at their place for almost a week. Unforeseeable things happened with my supposed to be plans before I actually stayed at Carmen's but she was really nice to save me from all the hassle. Her dogs and cat were really sweet! Her place was so clean and cozy, amazing! She always checks on me if I made it safe considering that I'm travelling alone in NYC. Very approachable even if she's busy running around and doing her everyday stuff. I will definitely recommend her to people that don't mind staying in Brooklyn. I actually got to appreciate the convenience of using the subway and having it a few steps from Carmen's place. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Carmen is a wonderful guest,she's very nice and welcoming!She like to know about you and explain you everything very well!Arrive there from the airport was really simple, the room was so cosy and confortable.Anything bad about Carmen :) she's very nice dont hesitate to book there </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Carmen is a nice host, very easy to reach. She allowed me to change my reservation a bit, which she didn't have to do. That was really nice! However, I did not enjoy my stay at Carmen's place. The place is quite far from Manhattan and the neighbourhood could be nicer. (However, there's a metro station quite close to the house.) Our room was worse than I expected. Super small. One can get better pillows at 1$ shop. There was a plastic cover over the mattress which I could feel while in bed. Also our duvet didn't have a cover. There was just one  sheet covering it. The walls,  floors and furniture need some renovation. Finally (and this was mentioned in Carmen's description)  the sleeping pods for other guests were just in front of my room. I didn't like that as I didn't feel I have any privacy. I I guess that for the price the place is ok-ish. But I would definitely not return. I don't mind spending 20 dollar more per day and staying at a nicer place. Btw, I did that. My trip was split into two parts, and when I returned I stayed elsewhere and enjoyed my stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The stay was relatively not so bad. But I have to say I may not stay here again. I stayed here with my family including a 20 month baby. The apartment was located in a good area. Close to museums and central park. But all windows were faced with a big street and 2nd floor location couldn't avoid from noise.  There are two bathrooms and a children's room. They were very useful for baby's play and after sleep. Air conditioner was very helpful for the summer season. There are no hair dryer, you need to bring or buy it. Kichen was a bit dirty, pans were oily and unable to remove. All closets were occupyed with host's belongings and couldn't use them. You need to keep your clothes in your bags. Hospitality was not so good. Very few instruction and low cleanliness. Only we were teached before check in were how to get a key, internet passwards and TV channels. In total, the apartment was not so bad for a family with children, but you may need patience for unwelcomed feelings.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We arrived at 1130pm and let our hosts know early that same afternoon. Regardless of the advance notice we were later told that we bad harassed them by contacting them at the time we arrived.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Just like in the photos on the website, you can't go wrong there. Iryna lives upstairs and can help with if you need something... Really helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>STAY AWAY FROM THAT PROPERTY... Both the host and the building owner are extremely RUDE, he knocked on the door and opened with his own key without asking  and invaded my privacy saying a lot off bad words and screaming because we were using the balcony and we didn’t we weren’t supposed to use it He doesn’t know how to deal with the public plus when I checked out the lady didn’t say anything not even introduced herself i asked a couple questions she pretty much ignored me, just walked us to the house and left, if u guys are looking for an ARBNB just stay away off this property, for sure you will get a better service anywhere else, don’t waist your vacation dealing with this kind of people PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE !!!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Melissa's place was a great price. It was in an amazing location and we loved the garden so much. The issues we had was the size was quite small, we were two and it was tight. The other issue was the cat. We are animal freaks and usually prefer airbnbs with animals but this time it was not the case. The apartment really smelled of cat litter, we had to change the cat litter multiple times because it was so intense. The other issue was the cat cried all night long. We slept pretty terribly because of it. This coming from animal freaks says something.  I feel bad writing a negative review but I would want to know before spending money to stay somewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The host is very nice and tries to help. However, the room and overall service is much worse than expected.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>What a great Airbnb! I’ve never had such hospitality from a host!! Kumar even offered to have us over for coffee at his place, which was incredibly thoughtful. I didn’t get in until 10PM and was dropped off at the wrong address. He quickly answered the phone and helped direct me to the correct house and made sure I got in, which was very much appreciated! Additionally the apartment is located very close to the subway, a deli, and multiple coffee shops. Kumar also had great recommendations, which are close to the apartment in case you want to walk! Overall amazing experience and would love to stay there next time I make it to the city!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I chose the wrong check out date on my previous booking and the host was more than happy to help me get that extra day booked. His email replies were speedy and made sure the whole process was seamless.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The Cleanest Place in Airbnb Worldwide, seriously. Luis and Victor are really caring, as all the other reviewers mentioned. You find a welcome pack on the bad, with some candies, towels, and pasting and brush tooth (that we had lost a day earlier, so that was very useful for us). We stayed 2 nights, and their place was perfect for that! Thank you both, </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Luis and Victor are amazing! So great at making us feel like home, providing towels and all the stuff you need to. Also we were free to cook and use the microwave. Location is on point, so close to the subway, M, J and G lines. We would arrive at the apartment at midnight and we were 2 girls walking on the streets and it was totally fine. If you are going from JFk to their home you can use J line, its so easy and fast. My friend and I wanna thank them so much for helping us on everything, including going downstairs with our luggage that were heavy!! The only bad point it's that there is no elevator and you have to go upstairs after a tired day, but that's almost all brooklyn houses/apart. There is also a Walgreens next to the subway, were we bought some food, and Mcdonalds, Dunkin Donuts, a DOLLAR TREE!! \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Angela was amazing! We arrived in the wee hours of the night and we mistakenly went to the wrong door. She had no problem waking up and showing exactly where to be (it was almost 2am!) The room is very comfortable & slept 5. The bathroom was very clean and the neighborhood is well kept & quiet. We enjoyed every moment of our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Simone’s apartment is awesome, really cool space which is not only great for adults but was perfect for travelling with our two year old as well, as there is a child’s bed and some toys. The only issue was that we were given the wrong number for the person that was checking us in, which was pretty worrying for a moment as we had no other way of getting in touch and my wife and 2 year old were stuck on the sidewalk with no where to stay. The person did manage to get in touch and we got in ok eventually. Simone is a really nice guy and the check in issue was an honest mistake which I’m sure is a one off. I definitely recommend the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very good location.  We were disapointed with the condition of the apartment. The A/C was very weak and barely reached the rooms. the bathroom was in a very bad condition. We do not reccomend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Meredith was amazingly prompt with communication and more than accommodating with check-in. As a native New Yorker, I was relieved to see that her apartment building (with elevator) was on a quasi-quiet street (busy is good... people out and about) but her apartment is tucked away towards the back which offered loads of quiet and privacy.  It is clear that the neighbors care about their space. That's always a great sign! The apartment was clean,  spacious, had TWO air conditioners (what a blessing). The bathroom had basic amenities which made it easy for me as I forgot to pack a few things. The bedroom is bright and airy and the bed was very comfortable. Her living area has a dining table, tv (cable) and enough space to lounge out. Kitchen was stocked with dishes/pots etc... Bodegas and restaurants/bars very very close.  One major subway stop (with 4+ subway lines) is about a ten-minute walk, which can be along an industrial avenue (not bad, just not flowers and sunshine.) There is another subway stop way closer, but it may take a few transfers from your destination point to get there. \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>A truly five star stay. Lots of space, great location, excellent tips. You can't go wrong with Meredith apartment. We are definitely coming back! Airbnb as it should be!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ik  verbleef 12 dagen met mijn moeder bij Terrance als eerste airbnb ervaring. Het is ons zeer goed bevallen. Terrance was echt een Superhost, niets was voor hem teveel. Wij konden bij hem terecht voor al onze vragen over de omgeving. Hij liet ons onze eigen gang gaan en wij hadden ook geen last van de andere gasten die tegelijkertijd in het huis verbleven (eigen kamer). Keuken en badkamer waren netjes en schoon. Wij hadden niet het gevoel dat wij het huis deelden met Terrance of andere gasten.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ons verblijf bij Terrance in Brooklyn is goed bevallen. De kamer was basic, de gedeelde keuken en badkamer schoon.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Staying with Natasha was the best experience ever. She was so welcoming and always available even before I moved in. She really opened up her home and I never felt uncomfortable or as if I was an unwelcome guest. She k ow the neighborhood really well so if you're like me and new to NY, she's there to give advice on the best places to ear, how to take the subway, and anything else you might need. Although I had some mishaps along the way (i.e. losing my keys and locking myself out of the apt), she never made me feel bad and made herself available to help. My only regret is that due to our busy schedules, we were never able to actually hang out together like we had planned. Also, the neighborhood is very safe. The building is key accessed and there is a police station right down the street. I never felt apprehensive or uncomfortable walking at night. I would definitely recommend staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Amy & Jay were very accommodating when we arrived early. They had the cleaning service to expedite their services so that we can rest after a long flight. Jay also assisted us in finding the location and assisting with are luggage when the Uber driver decided to drop us off in the wrong location. The house is beautiful and very spacious. Love the fact the house had a washer and dyer. Would come back again and recommend this house to everyone!!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I felt kind of bad at first since he just answered me with an automatical answer in airbnb app, and he wasn't at the home in the check-in time and it was like playing hide and seek to find the keys to get in. Also its location was kind of dangerous since it's located in the central Harlem. And the house needs some cleaning since we saw many ants in the room and the bathroom was kind of dirty. And we've never saw William during our 6 days of staying and never informed us about the other guests staying in the same place with us. And the keys are not working well since the doors are kind of old i think, it seriously need to be fixed. Anyways i enjoyed the new york but there's a few things that William should take care of. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Andy and his roommate were very welcoming and even had time to chat about the area.  The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the place was very quiet at night.  Highly recommended if you need a place to lay your head after a long day out exploring and to take breaks.  The bathroom situation was not bad at all, except for a dirty looking shower.  The shower was relatively clean, but it had an unkempt look to it.  Hardly a downside, but don't expect a hotel bathroom.  Will definitely stay again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I didn't meet Andy, but I was greeted by Keith, his roommate, who explained to me how things worked out in their location, neighborhood was pleasant and quiet, I ate around a lot and enjoyed the food from nearby restaurants a lot, I walked around very late at night and there were no issues. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would recommend it!! (except for the fact that I UNFORTUNATELY got sick with the flu on my last day at their location, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the hosting/room or anything, just some bad luck on my part, I guess.)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mijn verblijf bij Andy was geweldig! De privé-kamer was groot genoeg met een heerlijk bed. De badkamer is gerenoveerd en ziet er netjes uit. Verwacht geen super luxe badkamer, maar alles zit er gewoon op en aan. Het huis ligt niet verder dan een aantal minuten lopen van het metro-station Bedford-Nostrand. Echt ideaal! Je bent zo binnen 30 minuten van het huis tot hartje Manhattan. Ik ben een aantal keren laat naar huis gegaan, en heb me altijd veilig gevoeld. De buurt in Brooklyn is netjes, alles ligt er bij elkaar. Zo ligt één straat verder een supermarkt en een bank. Ook verschillende eetgelegenheden kun je om de hoek vinden. Andy en Keith zijn beide hele fijne gastheren. Altijd in voor een praatje en zeer meedenkend over wat je gaat doen en of hebben wel tips voor je. Al met al, een heel fijn verblijf gehad en raad dit huis zeker aan! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great hosts. Unique neighborhood! You can’t go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed here for 4 nights and had a great time. The apartment is really big, clean and beautiful and Katja took good care of us when we arrived. The neighborhood didn’t seem really good. A police car once stopped us asking if we were lost. However we didn’t have any problems and took the subway home every night without any bad experiences. You get really good value for the money at this place compared to New York standards. If you’re only looking for a place to sleep then it’s probably better to find a smaller place closer to the city. But if you want some more space and a place to cook some food then this is perfect.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You can’t go wrong - lovely home, sparkling clean, coffee and snacks available, near lots of restaurants and shops and nearby metro station.  And if you’re driving, street parking plentiful.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great space in a quiet neighborhood right off the park. Easy access to the subway!  No a/c for those hot summer days but let’s face it, if you’re just hanging out in an apt in Brooklyn when traveling, you’re doing it wrong! Get out and enjoy the city. (PS - there’s fans so all is not lost and you’ll survive).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was immaculately clean, value was great,  and the host was so sweet and very quick to respond and help in any way. The location was great, close to a grocery store and places to eat, and very close to subway. The only thing that wasn’t  so great for me was the thin mattresses, but I also have a bad back...overall it was great and I’d come back anytime!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time at the place. The room was lovely, clean and most importantly the space in the room was bigger than the picture! You have the queen size bed, a closet, a decorating fireplace, a small desk and 2 matching chairs, and a small “kitchen area” where you can simply make a quick breakfast. The shared bathroom was actually not bad at all. We never had any problem. And the bathroom was very clean and the dream to any minimalist — you got everything you need but it’s still simple, clean and no chaos!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"My experience at Waundell' s place was bad: I was locked out of the house for 3 hours on the last night of my stay. Briefly, the facts are as followed: When I checked in I told Waundell I usually come back lahte at 6night (I am a law researcher conducting research at Columbia of which I am an alumni. Columbia is open until 1 to 3am and i tend to follow that schedule). I also followed the same schedule with all previous Airbnb hosts and had no problem with them. Waundell said he has no problem with my schedule. However, on my 1st night, i felt unsafe to come back there at 4am, so I spent the night at a friend's place. I cameback the next morning at 11am. Waundell said he was worried for me and called Airbnb to look for my emergency number. I thought he was thoughtful and said: \"\"Sorry for making you worried</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Maireni was a very good host, on the first day he helped us out with the heavy luggages. He also gave us some cold bottled water to drink since it was a very hot day when we arrived. Maireni is very supportive and friendly. The room was fantasyic; the beds are very comfy and the room is very spacious. The neighbourhood wasn't too bad, the apartment is very close to subway and it's only about 30 mins from Central Manhattan.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Super clean!!! So clean you feel bad to sleep in the beds! Very comfortable sleeping and Maireni is very welcoming.  This is a basement apartment. Around the corner you can find a store which sells everything including breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Parking is on the street so it's good because you don't have to pay the high prices that you expect in NYC.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Quiet neighborhood  and a great location one block away from the 3 & 4 train.  The two beds were nice since I was traveling with my daughter. The apartment is pretty close quarters, so if you are looking for a more private setting you may want to look elsewhere.  Also, the upstairs neighbors could be heard and the pipe that ran above our heads would bang during the night. All in all it wasn't bad, and I am not looking for luxury when I travel to NYC due to being out and exploring.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Aangenaam verblijf. Vriendelijke mensen. Soms moesten we wel wachten tot wanneer de badkamer vrij sas. Staan steeds klaar om op al je vragen te antwoorden. Verder geen andere problemen gehad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Eerste keer in New York, en direct verliefd ! Ook dankzij dit verblijf. De kamer is inderdaad niet groot, maar geklimatiseerd , het bed is prima en de badkamer zeer proper. Lisa's huis ligt in een zeer aangename, rustige , residentiële buurt met tal van gezellige café's en restaurants vlakbij. Ook een schitterend park om uit te blazen op wandelafstand ! Lisa is zeer behulpzaam en je voelt je direct thuis. De Metro is op nog geen 8 min stappen en die brengt je vlot naar alle wijken van NY. Een dikke aanrader. Karen & Jean uit Flobecq, België</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lisa's place was super cute. She was very accommodating with our late arrival. We felt bad arriving so late and we tried to sneak in but the squeaky staircase gave us away. This location is super close to the subway and there are tons of food options around. We were so glad that this room had air conditioning as the heat and humidity were no joke. Thanks so much for a pleasant stay.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Really great space and our hosts were very communicative and accommodating to our travel needs for check-in.    A lovely home, tastefully decorated and welcoming in a charming neighborhood in Western Brooklyn.  Really can't go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"The apartment was beautiful, very good location. Close to a metro station. Just 30 min to downtown. And the room in particular is very cozy. However, there were some issues. The host was traveling in Europe and although she was very nice and willing to help, the person in charge of waiting for me and preparing the bedroom was not that responsible. I know that my arrival was in a bad day: January 1st at afternoon and many people had hangovers. But if you have a commitment, you have to fulfill it. She was not here when I arrived. When I called her (at 6pm), I thought she was sick but it was just hangover. Her brother came instead 15 min after I called. Very nice guy. She was also in charge of changing the sheets. She did not do it. Just two nights later when I complained several times to the host. The garbage at the kitchen was full when I arrived and almost all the dishes were dirty. There was just one cup available for breakfast. There were other girls in other room that had the same complaints and they decided to do the dishes although it was not their responsibility. And if I do not tell this person to take the garbage out, maybe the garbage would stay there still. Finally, one night when I arrived I noted somebody took some of my oranges and there was a big mess in the living room. I left a post-it saying \"\"Please</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I can say our stay was okay and ended really awkward. First, when we booked the place Elia did not reply until four days before our check-in date. We have sent e-mails and text messages many days prior to our check-in date and then we gave up thinking we would not need to cancel the booking because she might just be really really busy. We were planning to just go to the address she wrote in her ad in Airbnb. Then I received a text message from her saying she has replied to my email in AirBnB after we exchanged an email where she informed me that the address in the website is wrong. I replied to Elia's first e-mail. This happened on the evening of October 6 at around 8:36PM. I apologised for seeing the email just then. She did not apologise for not replying to my queries nor my text messages the first three says I was trying to reach her after I booked the place and after she accepted the booking. I just needed a confirmation from her that she read my emails and to know which place we will meet her to get the key to the apartment. I also tried to call her but there was no answer. I asked if my friend could crash for the night and if not it is alright. No reply at all. I understood immediately that they could be very busy. When we reached New York, before our check-in time, we informed her that we would be late because we are still with some friends catching up since I haven't seen one of them for 6 years. Her room mate Lolo was nice to text me that she stayed home to wait for us but also that she cannot wait for us until 4:00PM because she is leaving ASAP. It was alright for me because everyone has their own schedule. Lolo informed us that Elia will not finish before 4PM. So we rushed to the address Elia gave us so we could check-in with Lolo or with Elia. Elia then messaged me to arrive earlier than 4:30PM because she also needs to go out. We arrived early as requested by Elia which was 3:30PM. She said she needs to go to Midtown at 5:00PM. We told her we are downstairs but there was no answer, I tried calling but there was no answer either. We did as they both requested even though we have agreed already about the 4PM check-in. Lolo did not have to wait for us from 12:2:00Pm at all because we clearly said 3:30-4:00PM we will get to their place to check-in. We were waiting outside the apartment building just to know that Elia was going to be late. We said it's alright and we patiently waited. She arrived even later than 4:15PM. These are all understable still for us. WE ARRIVED AROUND 9:09PM at their place. Later that night my husband was woken up by...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Heather's apartment was beautifully designed, full of personal inspiration and cool things to admire. The room was very artsy. The bed was comfy, but made for one. There is an air mattress though. Heather was kind, friendly, and caring. We had a little miscommunication problem during check in. Heather unexpectedly ran late to let us in, but she did offer us a discount for the delay and we were very appreciative. The space was meticulously clean and lively. Overall we enjoyed the stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy place to crash. It's conveniently located near major subway lines, and despite other reviews, the area is really not bad-if you're a city person. Thanks Heather, for everything. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Neighbors in the building were slightly off, strange smell in the hallway. Other than this nothing bad to report. The owner made us feel welcome with a few snack upon arrival. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Joseph's apartment was great. I needed a place for my parents to stay near my apartment and this place was perfect. Joseph greeted us and helped us settle in. The apartment is pretty, with plenty of light, nice hardwood floors, and a very comfortable living room. It was very clean. He also has a beautiful piano (too bad we don't play).  Had everything you could need.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Joe was a great host, communicator, and helpful! Loved his place- located on the first floor (easy to carry your luggage to when traveling), one block from Central Park, and accessible from the subway. For anyone looking for a good place to eat nearby, I suggest Cantina, which is a few feet away. Cool little spot. I flew into NY from LGA and took an uber to Joe's apt, which was only 15-20mins away for $27. Not bad! Overall, I had a blast in NY and his location is perfect for anyone looking to explore NY with the option to walk and grab a bite to eat at all the nearby vendors. Thanks Joe! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>When I first came across Danny's offering, I thought it was photoshop haven. I couldn't have been more wrong...amazing location, amazing skyline, coffee and pastry shops on the same block.  We lived on the balcony. Awesome experience overall in a great apartment. Thanks for a genuine NYC trip!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My friend and I stayed at Max's for four nights, it was a great experience! Max was very helpful prior to arrival, and he sent this very nicely made PDF as a guide to his apartment and the city. I know that many of the other reviews mention how great Max is in person, but too bad for us we never actually met Max during our five days there as we ran on different schedules. But that meant we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves and it felt like home. I would stay at Max's again and hopefully we will be able to sit down and have a chat. The place is as described, and it is very very close to the Central Park.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Leesa's hospitality from the time we arrived to the time that we left was crème-de-la-crème!! Our flight arrived very late around 12:30am. I did let Leesa know our flight was coming in late. She was so kind. It wasn't a problem, she said. I felt so bad she had to come out so late to bring us our keys. Even when we got to the apartment, which was about 1:15am she had a wonderful smile on her face. She made us feel so comfortable. We even talked for a while, even though it was so late. That's how comfortable we all were. She showed us where everything was and the wonderful breakfast items that we enjoyed everyday. Look forward to coffee, tea, fresh fruit, croissants, and these wonderful gourmet sausages. We felt right at home from a long day of walking in New York in hot July. Leesa's mom (Karlin) was very nice as well. The first time we spoke it seemed as though we knew each other for years. Karlin made us smoothies one day. What wonderful unexpected treats. Another very nice and unexpected thing Leesa does and doesn't have to do. In the bathroom in a basket things that you may just have forgotten to pack, like shower gel, shampoo, lotion, etc. That was very nice. I have stayed in many rented homes and apartments around the world as well and have not been treated with so many wonderful extras. Leesa really goes out of her way to make you feel \"\"very welcomed.\"\" What a lovely family. The neighborhood was very comfortable. Easy to walk around and the train station is just 1 nice New York block long. A nice walk. It's a lovely apartment. Very clean. You will feel right at home. When my plans call for New York</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I couldn't say anything bad of our time in Anna's apartment, everything was great. Anna has been a great host, always attentive and ready to help us in everything we needed. The apartment is in an area that is easy while close to the city center (10 min by subway), 5 min to Central Park and with a good set of restaurants around where it can be enjoyed any kind of food (e.g. mediterranean, American, Italian, etc.). I really recommend Anna's place if you want to have a good time in NY!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The priximity to MSG makes getting a cab impossible.  Traffic was literally stand still for a week.  Lights from adjacent buildings and MSG flood the apartment.   No black out shades.  We had to buy masks to sleep, not kidding.  We had two major leaks in the apartment, one flooding the entire kitchen, bathroom and storage areas.  I spent 4 hours mopping, trying to stop the water from its source.  It flooded the nighbors apartment below and he came up in a pretty bad mood.  No TV which is no big deal if the internet works which it did not most of the time.  I moved my wife and son to my wife's moms house in CT the last three nights and rented a hotel room the last night.  Total disaster for us.  This is not a rental for families, it really should not be rented until the issues are addressed in a meaningful way.  Oh,  had to take all laudry to a laundromatte 8 blocks away because laundry machine leaked as well.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Being a Ten + year loyal Air BNB customer and at times a host, I have had a very hard time writing this review at risk of destroying my impeccable history, but after careful consideration I have decided that something must be said. Regardless of how bad a situation is I always believe people should be given the benefit of the doubt and you try to work things out, but Ani was not willing to talk. I booked the apartment for my girlfriend who had twin 4 year olds and myself. When my girlfriend arrived at the apartment. The host was still cleaning the place and it was a mess. She acknowledged that there was \"\"a staging she had just before\"\" and then went on to explain that the reason the fire exit door (to the outside world) was damaged is because there was a flood recently and they had to break in?  She left with beds made</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The host was very accommodating. Place was nice but could’ve been cleaned up a bit prior to arriving (clothes and towels could’ve been put away, floors could’ve been swept, etc.). The bed was large and comfortable (the sheets seemed clean from what I can tell). The neighborhood was accessible to many things such as a 24 hour corner store and the Franklin Ave subway station was walking distance away. Overall, my stay wasn’t too bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We really enjoyed our stay at Gina’s place!  The flat itself and Gina were great. The flat was really large and adorable.  It was a great mix of homey with the comfort of a hotel stay.  She had sample size shampoo and conditioner available for us, which was perfect for my uber forgetful kiddo.  The location in midtown was really great for us too.  It always felt safe, even walking late at night and was close to public transit (bus and subway lines) as well as several places we wanted to visit, including Central Park.  I know Gina warns you about the stairs, but it really is not too bad and I am not in particularly good shape.  I must admit I do not have the buns of steel promised/warned about.  So, we may have to go back again and stay at her flat as part of a good work out regimen.  Gina was really flexible with our arrival and departures.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>If you’re looking for a cheap, convenient place, then this place will be great! The host is very lenient on check-in/out times and provides everything you need when coming in (bathroom supplies, water, towels, even breakfast!). Outside can get a little loud but still not too bad. Overall a great location/host for the price!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had an awesome stay at Hernan & Chelsea's apartment. The room was small but convenient because it had a closet in which you can easily store your suitcase. The neighborhood wasn't as bad as we expected it, so you don't have to worry about coming home late. Everything was very tidy and clean and they even provided us with towels and a hair dryer. Hernan & Chelsea are awesome people, who welcomed us with great hospitality. We would always come back when we visit NYC again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed there for 2 days and we loved it. The communication was great and the location wasn't too bad, since I had metro pass so i always took subway line 6. It takes some time to get to the midtown. The host was very kind and the room was clean. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was a nice stay at Bowie's place. Great  room and convenient location. We didn't meet Bowie (that's too bad) but his roommate, Ali, was very nice. Thank you so much for everything again !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Thanksgiving family vacation gone bad. Jin was accusatory and rude to us. Beds extremely uncomfortable.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sheena was an amazing host, she's super cool and have a really nice place, very cozy and welcoming. We loved meeting her, too bad our stay was too short. The room and everything else is as shown on the pictures, very cute and nice! Thanks for everything Sheena! </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Lovely room, very cosey and very modern. The bed was comfy and the sheets were soft too. Handy having a TV also with Amazon Prime. Close to the subway and about 25 mins to Times Square stop so can't go wrong. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>GREAT place for such a GREAT price.  This was the neighborhood I grew up in and it was good to be back. It has changed for the better.  Nathan and George's place was in a great location, (quiet street), very nice building, and the room was large and very comfortable.  I have a bad back and thank goodness the mattress was firm.  A very welcoming couple.  Will definitely stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>My boyfriend and I flew from London to New York. We spent 6 nights at Nathan's place. The bed was really comfy, we had plenty of space for our clothes and baggage. There was a kettle available and the Air con for warm days. We did not use the kitchen so I cannot comment on that. I have nothing wrong to say about the flat. The dog Bear was so cute and welcoming.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Veranika explain us how we can go from the airport to the appartement. She was helpful. The appartement is very well located in Manhattan. The photos are similar. The inflattable mattress is so comfortable. The only bad thing is that it's a little smaller for 5 people. I would RECOMMEND it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Victoria was pretty good at first on communication. She gave us many of the rules that would be respectful of her things as well as the neighbors. However, when my partner and I arrived at the apartment building around 3:30-45ish we were told that the cleaning lady was in possession of the keys. This would not have been so bad but she still needed more than 30 minutes to finish cleaning the place. So we had to find something to do during that time. That was really disappointing and rude after a long trip to New York. We couldn’t relax right when we got there. The place still smelled of chemicals when we got back.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ame's plek was precies zoals op de fotos en in de omschrijving. Heel huiselijke omgeving, lekker bed, goede en makkelijke communicatie en lekker rustig. Goede ov bereikbaarheid en leuke winkels in de buurt. Prospect park is dichtbij wat heel fijn is. Maar Een andere kamer waar je de badkamer mee deelt en dat zorgt voor een lekker prive verblijf. Aanrader!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great stay and great host. The apartment was nice and well located. Thank you for his help and patience despite my very bad English.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Curtis is very kind and always answers the messages, specifies everything, a good host! the location of the house is very good, the subway is 2 blocks away, 2 minutes walking; It is the green line which is perfect since you can move anywhere from there !!! the apartment is on the 3rd floor, something that should be considered if you do not like climbing stairs. the apartment is a little different from the photos but almost everything is the same. The only bad thing in my experience was the cleanliness of the bathroom since I had to wash the shower to be able to use it and the sheets on the bed had a bad smell, there was dust and the other Airbnb's did not wash their dishes. Outside of that I would really recommend the place, comfortable, very accessible and with everything you need to have a good experience and bring your own towels, since the size is very small and cleaning products.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stay at this place is like staying at a boys dorm room in college, or a boys gym looker room. It smells pretty bad and needs a professional cleaning to be done to the whole apartment. I don’t recommend anyone staying here until that’s done. Especially if you have allergies. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great location. Easy walk to Central Park. We were only there to sleep, so you can’t go wrong with the price.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This is my second stay with Freda.  She is amazing.  I plan on staying with her next year when I am in NYC if her place is available.  You cannot go wrong staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Terry’s apartment is literally 2 minutes of walk from the Q 86th subway station. A lot of services are around and staying there was perfect. On a subjective side we were expected in Brooklyn 2 times during our stay. The subway route was 50 minutes each time. Not too bad but if you plan to go in Brooklyn yourself, you may consider a closer location. That (of course) has nothin to do with the flat “itself”. Everything was there; communication was A1 and we loved it there.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I've stayed in Takako's apartment for about 2 weeks, and everything was great. The apartment has everything you need. It's right above the subway C station, there's plenty of stores and markets around. Getting to Manhattan can take more than 30 min as the C train doesn't go too often, but it's not too bad. In overall, I was happy with my stay, would definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Hollis' place was great. Location was great, bodegas and grocery market are steps away. Subway is a block away (super easy to get into Manhattan). Place was roomy, ideal for 2-4 people traveling together. Finally Hollis was a great host! Gave us privacy but made it clear that we could call him if we needed anything. You can't go wrong with this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Didn't get a chance to meet Ryan because we only stayed one night, but he was a very reliable communicator and the space was clean and nice. The roofdeck was a nice thing to have, especially during nice weather. Plenty of good places to eat and drink in walking distance, and not too bad of a walk to the subway. Highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Deze kamer in East Harlem is uitstekend voor 'n week NewYork. Goed bed, sobere maar superschone badkamer. Gebruik van keukentje en koelkast. 2 minuten lopen van Target (Supermaché). Openbaar vervoer om de hoek.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall not bad</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I could not gain access to the apartment as the key got stuck in the door, there was nobody at the main house to let me in. Communication has been bad since I asked for a refund as I ended up not staying. Also the area is not the best and not what I expected.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice apartment! Wifi was pretty bad though, kept dropping out. Also there is no lift access in the building, if you need to use you have to contact the super intendent </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>If you have watched NY movies where people live in high ceiling brick buildings and you want to live that life for a while, this is a perfect place! Before coming I had questions whether the neighborhood is safe, but please be sure it is one of the safest neighborhoods in brooklyn. The cleaning service every week makes your life super easy! Yes, there are no elevators, but the stairs are not that bad and a 1 minute stairs workout is good for everyone! :) The place is a 10 min away from the subway by walking but if you are down to use uber/lyft, there will be one at your door in max 2 min - plus it is super close to nice places in williamsburg, greenpoint and bedford. For Manhattan, it is also easy to get to the city. The crowd sitting in the apartment is young and happy, which makes the atmosphere better. The room was incredibly spacious and the design of things were amazing too. I absolutely loved everything about Vida’s place. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I totally recommend  Julia's apartment nice design and really clean good comfortable bed!her friend Mauri had to wait several hours for us because late arrival , he was very friendly and helpful ! Unfortunately because of a water problem in the building we had to change apartments , but again Mauri was there helped us with the luggage and it was done very quickly to an other apartment around the corner also a nice place similar design fashionable and again very important very clean and also a very good bed!He even invited us for dinner because he felt bad for us! Perfect situated as well ! Book it! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Gaetano's appartement ligt op een centrale plek, is ruim, erg schoon en mooi ingericht. De kamer ligt in een apart gedeelte van zijn appartement dus daardoor heb je veel privacy.  Pluspunten zijn de twee badkamers met elk een eigen toilet, de airco, de ontzettend ruime schone kamer, en de lieve dikke huiskat \"\"Sam\"\"! De metro is vlakbij</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>BEWARE - Reported host and moved to a different AirBnB due to safety concerns. Read hosts’s personal reviews (not just review for apartment since he reposts to hide bad reviews). Place was not ready for our arrival, was not cleaned adequately, and basement smelled like sewage covered with air purifiers. Was double-booked due to his shady practice of reposting. You do NOT have the entire apartment... owners walk through the apartment to access theirs at all hours ( 4/5am).  Safety hazard: Front egress blocked by owners packages. Kitchen egress completely blocked with spare beds. Apartment cannot safely and comfortably sleep up to 14 people as posted, although due to black mold in basement, no one should even stay here. Call AirBnB customer service like we did to get set up with a new place; do not stay here.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was our first visit to NY. Perfect place for family. Close to the F train, clean and welcoming.  All the extra touches from providing us some groceries (breakfast) to a well appointed kitchen and bath, plus the convenience of the subway, you cannot go wrong. Aron is also quick in responding to my inquiries. Enjoy this Brooklyn jewel!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"We had a wonderful stay at Aron's place. The place is really cute with a great location just a couple blocks from the subway. Parking was also not bad and despite coming in late at night, we were able to find parking within a couple blocks for our minivan. Aron was a great host with prompt and helpful communication. He was really thoughtful and offered a white noise machine for our little kids. There were a nice selection of toys and games available as well as some movies. The kitchen was well stocked with the basics. The comments about the height of the ceiling as well as there sometimes being noise from above are true although the noise started at maybe 8:30 or so when we were already up. The ceiling didn't bother my husband or me (5'9\"\" and 5'11\"\") but agreed that you should think about whether it'll bother you before booking! We hope to come back another time when the weather is nicer and we can explore Prospect Park and other Brooklyn destinations!\"</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Aron’s unit is clean, bright, comfortable and in a perfect location for anyone visiting Brooklyn or Manhattan. The unit is very well appointed, especially the kitchen: dishwasher, full sized fridge, full sized stove, 12 cup coffee maker, microwave, washing machine, and dryer.  Aron provides many nice extras such as fresh breakfast items in the fridge, and a very well stocked bathroom with face cloths, hand towels and an array of bathroom “essentials”.  If you are tall, pay attention to his note about the ceiling height of this English basement unit. Other than that, you can’t go wrong with this reasonably priced 2-bedroom unit, especially if there are more than 2 of you!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a fairly large studio in a great location.  The train is a few blocks away but it's not too bad and there are many great area restaurants and bars.  It's the diplomatic neighborhood so safety is not a concern.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Alex is a welcoming and kind presence, and her space reflects the same. I have stayed many places, and Alex's apt really has been one of my most comfortable stays. Her place is meticulous, clean, and well organized, full of all sorts of beautiful vintage touches, from the bedroom, to the kitchen to the living room. The neighborhood is developing but honestly not as bad as I expected. Iron workers downstairs will be sometimes loud during the day, but not if you're here to see the sights. A great view of the statue of liberty from this area as well. Alex will tell you where to aim if you're looking for places to explore; she's been in the area for several years now and has watched it grow. A short walk away from Gowanus, and also not far to the more charming areas of Red Hook near the water, this place is really well worth the money.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Soonam, Maeve and Juane were very cooperative, friendly and accommodating. They facilitated me at every step right from the key pick up to storing my luggage until the room was ready. The place was absolutely terrific. It was exactly as shown in the pictures or maybe even better. It was immaculate and all utilities well provided for. The location was very central with easy access. My stay was very comfortable and the host provided me with all the information I required to find my way around town and enjoy my vacation. I would recommend anyone coming to New York to stay here. I think they are a bit modest describing the place. You can't go wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Paul’s place. While I didn’t have the opportunity to meet Paul personally, he was very prompt and responsive with any and all questions that I had. Paul’s place is extremely clean and comfortable which was wonderful. The bedroom was a great size and the bed is extremely comfortable. Paul was even thoughtful enough to leave a few waters and snacks for us upon arrival. The location is great and easily accessible to the A and C train lines. Parking wasn’t too bad, you’ll just have to remember to change sides depending on the day. Overall a great stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location, super convenient. The bed is a not firm enough, that’s too bad. Apart from that all good! Friendly host, thanks for everything</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay here! Hanayo and Shay were very accommodating and friendly! They even went out of their way to help out with a delayed train situation due to bad weather and made an unexpected delay much less stressful.  We could not have asked for an better rental. The space itself is large, clean and well stocked; soap, dishes, toiletries etc. Not much needed to be asked about. Plus WiFi was easily accessible. The location was great with many shops and restaurants close by and most importantly, easy & quick access to the subway. The wonderful Prospect park is very close as well.  Everything about this apartment was perfect for our stay.  We would highly recommend it, plus Brooklyn is great!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>5 large dudes stayed  here for an even in the city. The air mattress is one of the better ones and the queen bed was comfortable. The bed rooms don’t have walls to the celling so bring ear plugs if people snore. The toilet isn’t the best. The AC unit with the many fans worked well for cooling the rooms. Overall not a bad place to stay near a ton of stuff. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Leandro is such a nice person, he was kind , helpful and He always was available. His apartment is nice and cozy , the bed was really comfortable and the bad room was modern and clean.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A very nice stay although the badroom is a bit old-fashioned. Very good connection to Manhattan with metro line 7 in 10 minutes. Jonathan is a very friendly man with a good hospitality. If you won't spend dubbel price in a simple hotel good to Jonathan.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nadat we in overleg iets eerder konden aankomen werden we hartelijk verwelkomd door Faye en haar schattige zoontje. In de koelkast lag wat te eten en drinken klaar. Ze was erg behulpzaam bij de vragen die we hadden. Later die avond kwam Amiyr kennismaken om ons te verzekeren dat we altijd aan konden kloppen bij evt. vragen. Het appartement was goed af te sluiten en verder prima ingericht en heerlijk ruim voor ons vieren. De bedden waren goed, alleen de badkamer is wat klein. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was a great place! Took a little longer from manhattan to the house becausw of the subway delay (due to construction i heard?) But wasn't so bad! Just FYI</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything worked out well here. My first Airbnb a success! I decided to try it out while on business for a few days in NYC and this didn't disappoint. Sarah was very flexible and friendly as well. Her place is set up perfectly for a guest/roommate, as bedrooms are on opposite sides of the living room. Checking in/out was awesome too. Elevator and doorman are key in NYC and Sarah's building has them both. easy walk to the subway and plenty of local eateries. I'm back in again in 2 weeks...too bad Sarah's place is already booked!  Will definitely keep on my list for future trips though.      </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I’d booked Mio’s place for four nights but after waking up covered in bug bites after the first night I immediately booked a hotel and moved out. Mio was helpful and nice to deal with when I booked/arrived and it takes a lot for me to leave a bad review, but his place wasn’t clean and when I explained the situation and the bed bug bites he refused to even discuss reimbursing me and instead turned it around and tried to blame me for bringing bugs into his home. Needless to say the accusations in combination with his lack of interest to come to a mutual solution only made a really bad situation worse. Because I hadn’t taken picture evidence of the uncleanliness (I only took pictures of the bites) Airbnb couldn’t help me get a refund. Very expensive mistake.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location was amazing (very close to subway hub), apartment was comfortable & quiet, & Monika was super sweet! And her cat was super well behaved, and I've had a lot of bad AirBnb animal experiences so I'm picky! Just block him when you open the door (little escape artist!) Would 100% stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is good and the bedroom small but fine, unfortunately the living room was a total chaos with staff all over and bad smells. The most annoying part the bathroom, the toilette wasn't working well. I saw the other reviews (pretty good) probably just a bad experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a bad experience because the place was not clean, dust, cat hair and mould. \n</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Susan and her roommate are very kind and personable hosts, the apartment is easy to find, and they make check-in/check-out a breeze! The value is also really hard to beat. Beyond that, there were some features that were better/worse than I expected. Better: the bathroom. You have your own bathroom, and it's seriously amazing. Like I wish my bathroom were that updated. Worse: the bed. The mattress is old/springs are broken, so it really hurts your back after 1 night. The bedding is also pretty threadbare and doesn't stay on the bed. Overall, though, the place is a great deal and the hosts are amazing!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>wonderful apartment to stay in. The space is lovely, with a comfortable bads, and a kitchen stocked with the necessities. Very close to Central park and subway. thanks</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>5th floor walk up on first avenue by the queensboro bridge so it’s loud. AC in every room which is great. It was very clean. Laundry in the basement was a plus. The bathroom/toilet smelled bad (like really bad), they had like one of everything in the kitchen but not enough equipment to consistently cook your own dinner (1 big pot, 1 tiny cutting board, etc), appliances seem to be on the fritz. Comforters smelled old and musky.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Thank you so much  Antoinette for your hospitality, I am glad I choose your place during my stayed in New York for 8 nights. The appartement is very clean, elegant just same like in the pictures. Antoinette is very helpful host, with a charming personality, the breakfast has all high quality foods. The location not to bad, you can get to the train station in short walking, and get you to down tow in minutes. Definitely I recommended her place, and I will stay again next time I go back to NY.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location. Easy to visit and nice restaurants or stores around. Size is perfect for a couple. The appartement is as on the photos, nice atmosphere . Too bad there was some construction in the street.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed at Central Park Suite for three nights this week.  Evan was there as planned for check in.  The location of this apartment is the best.  Perfect access to the Park.  Very nice street and apartments.  As everyone knows, when looking for a place to stay, you realize you won’t be there that much because you’re out enjoying the City.  With that said, here are some things you should know about this apartment -  (1) pictures make it seem bigger than it is.  The bed is literally the width of the bedroom and living room also smaller.  Not a bad thing but just so you know, especially if you’re very tall.  (2) there were several extension cords with too many things plugged in.  (3) this apartment needs to be updated; the foyer and stairs going up to apartment need painting and cleaning.  (4) lots of creaking in floors.  (5) need better pillows and more appealing bedding.  \n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Quintessential Upper West Side Brownstone in one of the best neighborhoods in Manhattan!  True to the photos, this little gem is all you need to relax and chill while in the city.  Close to so many restaurants, shopping and services— as well as buses and 3 subway lines.  You just can’t go wrong.  Evan is a thoughtful host, with little soaps and shampoos, really everything you need.  The apt is second floor, but compared to many other places has little street noise.  It’s just a little gem and a value for the price.  I will return and already recommended to friends.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Great hospitality. Location is super duper great. Smack in the middle of Hell’s Kitchen. If you are a foodie, can’t go wrong with Kyle’s place. The street noise can be quite loud at night but they provide ear plugs. So thoughtful. Easy location to the train station and I had a wonderful experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This apartment is just 1 block away from the J/Z Gates avenue station, which I utilized every chance I could. I had never been to New York City before and was expecting a bad neighborhood, but I was surprised with how safe it was. There's a police station 3 blocks away and I never had any issues with anyone. However, there was no hot water in the shower, and for me that's a big thing because I did at least 6 miles of walking every day and all I wanted at the end of the day was to take a hot shower. The bedroom floor was also CRAWLING with ants. Anything that was left on the floor had ants instantly. My laptop had ants in the keyboard. I set my backpack on a chair and when I picked my bag up, the ants were all over the chair. I brought that issue up with the host so hopefully it will be better in the future. I really did enjoy my stay other than those negatives though.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ron was great at relaying to me where to park and how to gain entry.  Upon arrival I was amazed to find the space was even larger than expected.     Incredibly clean and comfortable.  The cupboards are stocked with all the dishes, cookware and cutlery you may need.  The bathroom is large, clean and has good water pressure.  Real Talk:  the bed is hard as a rock, the back yard is very unkempt and the stove was not plugged in.  I addressed the stove with Ron and told him I was able to light the gas range with a lighter and he said to just keep doing that.  Also, the houses on either side both appeared to be undergoing heavy renovations.  That being said, it was not too cumbersome, the walls are very thick, it was really only an issue when trying to spend time in the yard. Finally, just as someone previously stated in a review, a gentlemen started knocking on the window at 8am Saturday morning for about 20min.  All in all, the good outweighed the bad.  This place is exactly what I needed at a price I couldn't beat.  I would definitely stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was nice, comfy, and accommodating. Plenty of dishes and seasonings and towels. Even had blenders cork screws and chopping blocks, which is something you rarely get in an airbnb. Ron is an awesome communicator. When we had problems watching the Mayweather fight he got everything fixed. Loved my time here. TBH the bed is hard as bricks and uncomfortable but that's the only bad thing I'd say.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stacey is a wonderful host and this apartment is awesome!  It is clean, comfortable, great decor, located in a neighborhood that is full of fun shops, delicious restaurants, and easy access to subways.  Stacey and her son were super responsive to anything we needed, very friendly, and really helped us out when we needed to switch out of a bad rental situation.  They were quick to help us out and their apartment was a wonderful oasis to get to in a hectic time. We would highly recommend this apartment and Stacey!!!  And we would definitely come back here on future visits.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Zahid was great. Met us for check in and flexible when the meeting time changed, understanding about a delay because I accidentally sent my husband the wrong contact info.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Zahid was such a great host to us! We came into the city in the middle of the snowstorm and while waiting for him to check-in, he felt so bad that we were waiting in bad weather that he left his car and walked to us, which was so nice of him. The place itself was spacious and clean, with a nice balcony too. Location is great and a few minutes walk to everything (food, shops and subway). We do know that NYC is a loud city in general, but we did hear someone playing their music in the early morning hours, but just something to note. Overall had a great stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We really loved to stay with Gary. Communication was perfect and room and toilet as pictured. We had pretty good luck with weather and enjoyed the rooftop often to relax after all the wapking you do in NY. Gary is a cool guy, provided some good advises without being too brash. Neighbourhood , as mentioned by Gary,  may appear a little rough, but my friend and I, two young ladies, never experienced any bad experience, though we tried to avoid walking along the street at night.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gary and his girlfriend were super nice and welcoming! Never felt like a bother, which is very important to me! They were both very cool and easy to talk to, not awkward. The walk to the subway was not too bad, a bit of a commute to the City, but it was a really nice place and worth the price!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gary and his partner were very welcoming and helpful! The bed is very comfy and the summer heat is made bearable with the air conditioning. Just don’t forget to turn off everything when going out for the day-we forgot the first day and felt terrible because it costs them money. We like walking so the underground’s are not to bad in distance about 10 min! Wish we could go up to the private rooftop past midnight but I understand reasons why not. Space was great and we enjoyed our stay!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The place was very nice, bed very comfy and the location of the place is excellent. It just walking distance to different metro stations so you can easily get to manhattan and Bushwick and Willemsburg are closeby. Gary is one of the coolest guys I’ve ever met and had some great tips where to go in NY. You cant go wrong by booking this place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Chris' place was great! It was fine for 2 people but probably not more. Kitchen was very small so not ideal if you want to cook a lot, luckily there are many amazing restaurants close by. The location was a bit far from the main tourist activities, but very accessible on the subway. Chris was an extremely welcoming host and was well-prepared for guests (plenty of towels, extra blankets, toilet paper, etc). We did have an issue with the gas service going out - this was based more on our bad luck than on the quality of the building or Chris' hosting, and he was generous in helping us deal with the issue. Overall this place is a great value for any couple wanting to stay in the city on a budget.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>He was very attentive and was open to our floating schedule. The space is not bad. Decent location. There are people living in the space so be considerate of noise. Only downside was that there was broken glass in the hallway and my wife stepped on it. When I reached out to him, I received no response...you get what you pay for. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I stayed at James and Shaun’s place for two nights this past weekend. Communication was super easy - they were very responsive. I had a small issue during check-in where I was using the wrong key box, but luckily they were home and were able to let me in. Other than that, the apartment was very clean. My room had A/C thank god - it was very hot out. I didn’t spend much time in the room, but the bed was comfortable, and towels and a robe were provided. Their apartment is a short walk from the metro. Overall I had a great stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Es muy estricto en los horarios para hacer ruido, incluso los sábados, ya que permite que sea hasta las 0 hs.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You can't go wrong staying here. The apt is beautiful and comfortable. The view is amazing and the host is wonderful. Stop thinking and just book it already. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ons verblijf in het prachtige en kunstzinnig ingerichte appartement van Andreias was een bijzondere ervaring. Vanaf zijn persoonlijke ontvangst, de vele tips voor eettentjes en andere interessante plekken in de stad, tot het punt van vertrek, Andreias is een goede en sympathieke gastheer. De kamer was bijzonder en de bedden comfortabel. Door de van te voren afgesproken gebruikstijden van de badkamer, was delen ervan met de andere gasten geen probleem.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>There were 3 of us in the room therefore there will be 2 reviews because my grandmother is 80+ and didn't write one. Me: I feel like the room is okay to stay in if you don't have a family event or if you're a young couple just wanting to have fun in the city and explore. The house is artsy and cute! Just be aware there is other people in the house and so plan your shower either at night or early in the morning. Theres no hooks for your towels, or face cloths provided. I was cold and sick the whole time. It personally wasn't the best stay for me but I had an important family event to go to and we definitely choose the wrong room but like I said if you're a young couple then go for it! Mom: I will give a fair and honest assessment: We chose this location due to safety and its proximity to Central Park. Do not let that entice you. I found it to be too far from restaurants and other conveniences. Upon arrival I was intrigued by the different artsy and creativity displayed in the hallway as well as the appearance of the room. The host was soft-spoken and extremely quiet. As we settled in I noticed there was no where to hang up our clothing in the room, no place to hang up our wet towels and the room was very cold. This meant for the entire five days are towels never dried! We were not provided face cloths which we asked for several times and as a result we had to use the corner of our towels! There was one very small bathroom which three families plus the host shared!!! This was extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient! Many times we were all waiting to get into the bathroom to shower as well as for personal use! There were no paper towels to dry your hands, no Clorox wipes to wipe off the toilet or the wet sink that so many people were using! This was absolutely and extremely unsanitary! For my comfort and personal cleanliness I purchased my own. Upon our arrival we were asked to be quiet because of other guests. We couldn't play our music or talk on the phone because our room was right next to the host and I felt imprisoned as though I couldn't make any noise! I was on the phone and was asked to be quiet! This was not the way I wanted to spend my money or my vacation. On our second day there, the elevator went out and my 80-year-old mother had to climb the stairs! This apartment is located on the seventh floor! It was hard for us but for her it was dangerous! This of course was not the host fault but it is certainly something you want to consider when you choose a place to stay. As stated, online it appeared to be exactly what we...</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Nick and Julie are great host. We had the chance to exchange with them before our stay to prepare our journey and they were attentive to our needs. The apartment is fully equipped, the washing machine is a huge plus when you are traveling. A great thing to take in consideration is the check-in/check-out system which is really easy and flexible. You can not go wrong with this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Emmanuel was an amazing host. He provided bottled water, soap, fresh linens/towels, and a modern beautiful quaint apartment in an awesome area. He was very easy to reach and was very friendly. I could tell our comfort and needs were his first priority. He seemed like a very nice gentlemen and we would absolutely re book with him. If you are tall like i am (6'3''), just know that you'll have to watch your head in a few areas. It is a basement apartment so there are a few spots that are lower, but It really wasn't bad at all (i can get annoyed easily at things but i was fine, didn't even care about leaning a little). I love the location. It is along several bus routes to get to the subway, and is short walk to the LIRR. I grew up in the neighborhood and was happy to have a safe, clean, affordable place to stay in a good neighborhood. Pro tip VIPizza has the best Sicilian pizza and amazing regular slices (Bell blvd). Martha's and the French Workshop are both phenomenal bakeries that are on Bell Blvd. The Q12, Q13 are up the street and both drop you off right near the 7 train(along with several other options). Save money on getting around by using (Hidden by Airbnb) maps and public transportation. It's pretty easy ; )</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was as described in an incredible location (right on an F train stop). We enjoyed this apartment as our home base. There was some miscommunication about the key handoff so we had to wait a few hours to get the keys from a colleague across the street, as Solomon was out of town. Also, another reviewer mentioned a bad smell in the building (which is true because they keep the garbage cans by the stairs) but inside the apartment, everything was fine. Amenities were great. It's right on the street so be mindful if you are sensitive to city sounds. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a perfect location for wandering Central Park and visiting the various museums along its periphery. Don't expect fancy- our room was funky, but not in a bad way. The bed was comfortable, and it is the quietest place I have ever stayed in in New York (though you may have other Air bnbers in the room next to you, so your experience may vary.) The bathroom is shared with Andreias and any other guests. I had a little difficulty communicating with Andreias regarding leaving our luggage a couple of hours after check-in, but he was able to accommodate us and was very kind. If you are lucky, you might get to pet his sweet kitty :)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Andreias's place was creative and eclectic. The bed was comfy and the room a very nice size. With Central Park literally across the street and Harlem close, you can't go wrong. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was my first time experiencing Airbnb. Amdreias is an amazing host. Me and my boyfriend stayed at his place while I was visiting NYC. Appartment is clean, the location is the best. Not a bad view to wake up to (Central park view). Loved the location. Andreias gave me the list of local restaraunts that he likes and me and my boyfriend decided to check the Thai place out as Andreias suggested. Definitely would recommend the Thai place too! Overall great experience!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is great and Sameer is a good host. The apartment is below expectations given the price (at the time of writing as expensive as a room at The Standard). The condition of pillows was unacceptable: yellow and stained. I decided to take them to a laundry where i felt the need to justify myself explaining they are not mine. Kitchen has very ugly flooring and rough setup: not really presentable. The floor is beautiful but in very bad condition: holes as big as a finger fixed with duct tape, or even a bigger hole in the bedroom. Had socks broken by wood spikes and some nails in frankly dangerous position keeping down the wiring. Several windows did not stay open. Aircon so noisy it must be off at night in the bedroom. I would not stay again although the position is simply perfect.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This studio was great. Very comfortable and warm. It's kind of far from the city but not too bad. Fine for day trips. Location is peaceful and clean. The only thing the studio didn't have (or at least I could not find) was pots and pans. I had an overall great experience- I'd definitely go back. Highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tonia was great gave us all the info we needed for traveling the city. House was cozy and clean. The bus pick up to get to the ferry was just steps away for easy access to Manhattan. Travel could be tight on bus sometimes depending on time of day but hey it's the city not that bad. Enjoy her place and the easy access to the city great house guest. I will return soon. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I never met Sinem or Tolga, but communicated with Tolga over the app, who was very helpful and very responsive. Their Airbnb is ideal for a single traveler who is looking for no-frills accommodation in a cool neighborhood. Their place was on a trendy street in the LES and was 1 minute from the subway, and 10 minutes walking to Nolita. It's a 5th floor walk up, so bear that in mind if you have a lot of luggage / bad knees. The apartment is pretty small (maybe 350 sq ft?) but is clean and comfortable, and has a living room and small kitchenette. Both bedrooms are available to rent, and I was in the room closest to the street, which was slightly noisy on Friday and Saturday nights (there are many bars nearby), but I was fine with that. The room was clean and well lit, and although it was very cold outside (in the 20s and below at night), the space heater they provided with the room kept me very warm. The room was maybe about 14x8 feet, most of that space being taken up by the bed and some furniture, which I why I think it is best suited for just one person. I didn't have much luggage so I was cozy but comfortable. There was another traveler staying in the other room, who was very nice. Not sure if it was due to the cold weather but the hot water didn't last for very long (maybe 5 minutes or less), but I don't take very long showers so I didn't mind. Wifi was excellent. As a single female traveler I generally felt safe here. I thought the location was great and in close proximity to the best parts of LES and Nolita. Tolga was also very flexible about my checkout time and was more than accommodating when I asked to stay later in the day.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed with James for nearly 3 months in his amazing apartment in Brooklyn. I can honestly say I did not have a single bad experience during my stay, and it truly felt like home. He was always incredibly friendly and helpful whenever I asked for suggestions for restaurants, things to do, etc. Some days I wanted to just sit in and watch TV (thanks to the great TV with Netflix access in the guest part of the apartment, I caught up on the entire Lost series...), and he would leave me to it. When I wanted to chat, he was more than open to do that, too.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great host and a great apt. Location was excellent and parking wasn't to bad. Apt was clean, wifi working, tv working safe area. Sonia has been nothing but a great host. I very highly recommend using her services. Thanks again Sonia for all your help and support.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Definitely a good location. Right next to the subway in a great and safe neighborhood. Apartment does have a smokey smell but not too bad. I felt right at home. The only issue I had was checking in and out. I waited with my luggage outside the building for 20 minutes because the woman who gave me the key was late. When she showed up she was very sweet and explained it was due to the subway. After that it was a lovely stay in the building. Checking out was difficult because the women who was meant to take the key was an hour late, which almost made me miss my flight. Over all I would recommend this place. Very cute and convenient.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was good enough for a short stay. Could have been a bit cleaner, dust on floor and under dressers, linens had stains. Overall, not too bad.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Jack's studio is exactly as it appears. It is well stocked with necessities and is in a wonderful location for visiting many of the local attractions and shows. It is up 3 flights of stairs. Jack was very kind in responding to our late evening panic because we couldn't get in the second time. Turns out there is an identical door with a different address. Since we came around the block from the opposite direction, we were trying to get in the wrong door!  Thanks Jack!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>When we came to New York to study we've had very bad experiences with previous apartments. Finding Estees place was a real relief and made the last month enjoyable! The place is very clean and has everything you could ask for. Yes, the kids are lively, but we didn't bother. The location is very convenient with grocery stores and restaurants right around the corner. The subway is close and its a short trip to Manhattan. If you're looking for a place not only to stay but to live, this is it! Estee is a great host, very communicative and helpful with everything! Thank you Estee for having us! And obviously, I definitely recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Daniel is a nice host that is responsive via messaging but this Airbnb experience was quite bad. \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place has fantastic view. It’s a bit small, but that’s NY. In flat is everything what you need for your stay and Jeremy was ready to help with any issue, however the place was quite dirty. Overall not bad for the value.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a nice, modern apartment that's very comfortable.  Good natural lighting from the large windows, and a relatively large kitchen.  Excellent for a couple who want to be in Crown Heights.  It was great to have a washer and dryer.  The building is safe, clean and in good condition, and is air conditioned.  The neighbors are quiet, and noise from street is not bad.  Convenient subway connections.  Good communication by the owner, and easy check in/out.  The photos and description are accurate, and I would happily stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is really five minutes walking to the metro (and I walk slow). In the nights I pay 28-35 dollars in Uber from 5th Avenue. The bedroom is perfect for sleep (very comfortable bed) and the badroom is next to. I just see Sophia when I arrived, pero I knew she was only an SMS away: She always answer immediately!! That make me feel really safe in the city. Also, when I arrived she was wait for me and gave me a map and indications about the metro and the neighborhood. She and her family are great hosts.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sophie is a great host.She got everything we needed for our stay. The bathroom and the room are clean and nice.The location wasn't too bad. It takes less than 10min to the closest station and 30min to Manhattan.\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Jays apartment is just as described, spacious and clean. It is quite, feels safe, and have a nice terrace with a good view facing the park. You should also check out the rooftop terrace. The check-in arrangment picking up the keys at a nearby coffee shop was very practical as we arrived late in the night. However we did have som problems finding the right address due to the map showing the wrong place. Luckily Jays cohost helped us. The location is perfect, with a lot of shops and restaurants close by. Jay was also helpful with recommending some good places. I really recommend staying at Jays apartment and would stay here aging for next time. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>For New York standards, it's a big, beautiful apartment with an incredible outdoor deck.  However, expect some noise -- Bethany and her family live upstairs, and there were some loud crashes on the ceiling at odd hours (much louder than just normal footfalls).  There was also an issue with Bethany providing us with the wrong key and us getting locked out, but at least she remedied that relatively quickly.  All in all, it's a really beautiful place for New York, but there are some hiccups that go along with it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bethany is a great host - very helpful and responsive. Apartment has a 1 floor walk up which isn’t bad for NYC but be prepared to lug suitcases up and down narrow stairs. Amazing location! No blinds so between that, upstairs neighbors and construction - it’s not a place to sleep in or R & R. Futon beds in all rooms - not very comfortable. But very cute kitchen and spacious for a large party staying in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location with gorgeous view of Manhattan. Sonia is super friendly and attentive. However the space is more of a section off living room than a bedroom and the bed is not very comfortable. Overall, not a bad place to stay for a quick visit in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This studio has a great location and space for the price. However I was rather dissatisfied. The sheets and blankets were very dirty (even the back-up ones) which is unacceptable. The bathroom was filthy (I had to clean it immediately when getting there). And the heat is controlled throughout the building, not controllable in the apartment. It was uncomfortably cold every night I stayed there to the point of getting bad sleep. The TV also doesn't have normal cable or streaming services on it - only a paid service (as far as I can tell, not sure if I just didn't know how to use it but I use a Roku, Firestick, and a smart TV at home so I'm familiar with streaming services). So I couldn't watch TV all week. These are all easy fixes. If the owners make changes to fix these things, it would be a great spot to stay and a great deal. Super convenient, great location, great price. But the issues I experienced are big (easily fixable) issues. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The only good aspect of Drew’s place was the location , very handy although not “the heart of the west village “.   Other guests have commented on the bad plumbing (basin and shower do not drain), the poor cleanliness (the place stank of bleach but the sink was dirty ), being told only the day before that keys had to be collected four blocks away (not handy when you have luggage ), the flat, uncomfortable pillows (with textured nylon covers).... yet none of these complaints had been addressed for our visit. Add to this the missing towel rail in the bathroom and the unusable stove due to the extent of rust, plus the sealed shut window on the the fire escape (don’t think that’s legal ) and I wonder why anyone has given this place positive reviews. We won’t be back.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was the third (!) time I stayed at Anthony & Chelsea's place. Beyond ideal location, room, company, all of it. Can't go wrong with this stay!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The place is great. Very cute and cozy. The host is very transparent with the set up. It’s around a lot of cute bars and great breakfast spots. She’s very quick to respond. My friend and I had an amazing time. You can’t go wrong with this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The hosts were great and the bed was comfy.  My husband thought is was a little warm but we had an AC unit in our room.  They are on the 5th floor but it really is not that bad a climb.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is next to subway, however the neighborhood is bad. I felt unsafe.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Prime location, just about a block from the C train ! I had a quick stay for a wedding, and their spot has all the necessities plus some. Very convenient with AC unit in the room and fresh sheets. It is like a 5 or 6 floor walk up, but it’s not bad, that’s normal for NY and it’s an easy walk up even in NYC summer humidity. Just a fair warning, but pretty sure they make this clear in their description too. I recommend ! And I’ll be keeping this in my profile in case i need another nyc stay !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Small room. Bedsheets and towels smelled so bad and dirty</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It’s a cozy place and Dim makes the check in/check out very easy. The location is great. The only bad thing is the apartment felt dirty. There is a carpet throughout the main living space that looks as of it has never been cleaned. I certainly did not appreciate paying for a place that had permanent reminders of all the people who stayed there before me. The couch was also without a cover and clearly has not been cleaned either. The bathroom mats and hamper were also filthy. The kitchen cabinets were stocked with old food items and random products which didn’t add to the comfort level. I don’t think it’s right to advertise a cozy clean apartment and then have people pay to live among each others filth. Also, the AC worked on and off throughout the three days we were there. I would NOT stay here again. Pretty disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dim always response fast. The studio is sweet, but we had some problem with using flush toilet. It cannot work very well. The Shampoo in bathroom was used out and havn't be supplemented in time. All in all, not a bad choice in the centre of New York</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Williams place is great. It felt like home away from home. Very comfortable and quiet. Can’t say nothing bad about him or his place. I highly recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Niraj's place is a centrally located spot in the heart of Gramercy. You won't go wrong staying here - he is professional yet friendly and has a great spot he is able to share on AirBnB. Would stay again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place, Naomi is very friendly and helpful. Location is not bad either, about 10-15min walk to the metro, heaps of shops around. The only thing is it was extremely hot in NY, so without air con it can get a bit stuffy. The fans helped a lot though! :-)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Is a good room, the only two bad things: weak wifi signal inside the room and the room's heater is noisy sometimes</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You simply can't go wrong with this place. You get a comfy, clean room with an awesome air conditioner, mini fridge, coffee machine, hand steamer for your clothes, etc. Location is great too, short subway ride to Manhattan, and many places nearby such as Dunkin Donuts, Subway and a couple of deli's and liquor stores. Danielle is helpful and approachable, it will be my place of choice for all future NYC travel plans.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tiba's behavior was terrible when we booked the apartment on repeated occasions we asked her if we were going to share with someone else and she said no, but one day before traveling she told us that we were going to share a department with another person.  Also, when the person left the apartment, he admitted another guest, it was a very uncomfortable situation since we had agreed that we were only going to share with Tiba, it was a very bad experience, people like her  They lower the level of such a good application.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kimyon is a great guy and we had a good experience overall. He is great at communicating quickly and addressing your needs. We had a great time chatting with him about peace, spirituality and life. The apartment is quirky, generally clean and the neighborhood is the real ungentrified brooklyn - if you are looking for alternative and raw- this is the location for you. As a couple with a baby- it wasn't quite the right fit for us, but not a bad experience either, thankfully! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kimyon’s apartment is not for the luxury traveller, to say the least. While one night describe the apartment as “quirky” or “artsy,” I would decline in those descriptions. Kimyon initially requested for us to check in much later than requested and we ended up waiting outside the apartment until a neighbor let us in. The apartment itself is oddly furnished (art and quirks aside). There is no couch or seating area to speak of. Given we visited in June and it was quite warm out, the bedroom got very hot but there was no fan or AC to offer relief. Compounding the matter, the one window that could open slowly slid closed through the night. The bed was comfortable enough, yet it was accompanied by a shadeless lamp on the ground next to bed. I was tempted to stop at a store to buy a cheap fan and lamp— that small investment would drastically improve the bedroom experience. The bathroom was expectedly small (one cannot fault it’s size, it is New York after all). But neither the tub nor the sink drained, leaving me stranding in 5in of dirty shower water. Additionally, the WiFi was erratic and not reliable. I do not think Kimyon has bad intentions, but I would advise one to seek another listing. Kimyon was perfectly pleasant to communicate with, just the apartment was not accommodating or comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A nice homey small place with welcoming hosts that comes with a cute dog. Loved the terrace that is available for residents and guests. A bus ride away from Williamsburg and not too bad to get into Manhattan either — we walked a bit (maybe 15min?) to get the metro. Anyway we enjoyed our stay :)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Nicks apartment in East Village is a little diamond, full of character....this little hidden gem made my stay in NYC with my dad the most amazing and authentic experience....from the minute we landed, Nick was on hand...key collection from the shop around the block was a breeze...although there are a few flights of stairs to climb to get to the apartment, it didn’t bother us and my dad is 74! We both felt at home instantly......then nick told us about the roof!!!!! Breathtaking! No need for TOTR...you can see uptown, downtown and Manhattan bridge, stunning views...the area is amazing also, it’s east village, can’t go wrong really! We even made friends with the food wagon guys outside on corner(of 11th)  1st Avenue subway is 5 minutes walk away, if even! And if that is out of service(L (Website hidden by Airbnb) doesn’t run on weekends!)  Union square is only 10/15 minutes walk away...(bustle brilliant station)connections on subway are great  if you stay here you are truly honestly in an amazing spot \n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Check in was smooth. She was always available if there were questions by messaging. The place was very clean. Well located. Very short walk to the closest metro station.  Two flights of stairs but super easy. If you can’t do two flights of stairs you probably shouldn’t be visiting NY. Check out was also easy. Tons of dishes and things to cook. Pull out couch was ok for a a few nights. Not too much bad to say. Maybe the internet could be a bit faster</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Maybe it was bad timing, because the hosts were in the middle of a reconstruction phase, but the place isn’t for light sleepers. The cold air penetrating from the window didn’t help either. Aside from these two inconveniences, the place is clean, reasonably priced and perfectly located - a minute walk from the subway, and 15 minutes metro ride away from Times Square. The area is not bad either, a lot of supermarkets, delis and coffee places around the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Nice people, nice place and a nice neighborhood, you can't go wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very interesting location enjoyed my stay in Harlem.  Despite its reputation I felt very safe in this area of Harlem and didn't face any issues.  The bed is firm and comfortable I slept very well.  Glenda was a gracious host providing towels and easy check in.  There was a smell of weed from somewhere the first night I stayed - not my thing but others may enjoy that! The walls are fairly thin and unfortunately other guests were quite talkative so sleeping in wasn't an option.  Close to station. Very warm spacious room.  Overall not a bad stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>7 dagen in deze airbnb gebleven. Alles was netjes bij aankomst: schoon bed, en schone handdoeken waren beschikbaar. Maar later zagen we al gauw dat er mieren in onze kamer waren. Verder werden de keuken en de badkamer wel netjes schoongemaakt en bijgehouden.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Nikki was a great host- Took me out to a neighborhood bar for taco Tuesday. I don't think anyone has ever gone wrong with that suggestion!</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":50},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\n\nselect amenities, split, exploded\nfrom
