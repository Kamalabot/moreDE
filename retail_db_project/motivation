Motivation : Master the analysis process using the SQL query language. There 
are visualisation softwares out there which can provide exotic function. But the 
regular analysis and report generation requires faster output and standard chart
formats. 

Even standard chart formats, a lot can be packed. I want to master that process 
and then create dash-boards with it. 

This folder will contain series of analysis scripts with queries in them, with 
following format.


1) There will be an sql query involving the dataset in question.

2) Then there will be possible charts that can be created using the dataset

3) Further questions that the data can give rise

4) possible tangent of bringing un-related data to join and create new charts

The idea is to train on both querying the database for data and
 querying the data for insights
