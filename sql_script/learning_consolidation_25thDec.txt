Following is the list of points that i learnt today

1) The power of indexing became very clear after the indices where created 
on the existing columns in the database tables. 

2) Creating sequences and then attaching them to columns in the tables. Later using 
those sequences as the reference for foreign key 

3) Till now I have been joining the tables without any foreign key. In case of the 
analytical analytical process this is not very important. But for transaction it 
becomes crucial

Using the dbeaver ide for querying. Suddenly querying the database seems to be 
extremely pleasant. In fact I am ready to try out the queries, because they are less 
costly to type. 
- Auto completion of the table names, and column names
- Adding the table abbreviated call name
- using the from clause first to create the source tables, joining them
- then using the auto complete to select the tables that I am looking for.

To create a conceptual data model, the above exercise is not appropriate. The creation 
of index, foreign key are done at the physical level of data storage inside the 
database. 

For the conceptual model to establish the connectivity between the tables using 
join, and various pre-defined and aggregate functions would be more beneficial
